The cocktail menu is diverse but ask for details as the descriptions really don’t give a clear picture of what you are getting and we found the flavors to be just odd in three of them . The wine by the glass is limited and overpriced . Food is divided into “gems” second plates and main courses . We decided to start off with about 5 plates to share . The scallops were horrific and sliced horizontally in a milky broth that had no flavor ; a shrimp dish with peanuts was decent but weirdly presented with the heads detached from the tails and lined up on one side of the dish ………… We had three other items that were so unmemorable I have no idea what they were . We decided to skip ordering more and bailed around the corner to the Vietnamese restaurant bar for appetizers and drinks .

1844,"A Friendly Visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles I had been eagerly anticipating my first visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles, so I arrived bright and early on a Sunday morning at 9:45 am, only to realize that they don't open until 10 am – my bad for not double-checking the hours beforehand! But arriving early turned out to be a blessing, as a small line had already formed outside, and more folks were joining in anticipation of a delicious breakfast. Once seated, I ordered a glass of water, coffee, and orange juice. However, my excitement dipped momentarily when I noticed some food crumbs in my water. Nonetheless, I decided to give the menu a good look, settling on a waffle with maple pecan-infused butter and the American breakfast. The waffle, accompanied by its unique buttery topping, was decent, but not quite the flavor explosion I had hoped for. The American breakfast, unfortunately, didn't quite hit the mark either – the turkey bacon was a tad bland, and the sausage patties seemed a bit overdone. But hey, the buttery grits were surprisingly tasty! To my disappointment, the coffee arrived on the colder side and lacked the robust flavor I was expecting. Despite these minor setbacks, when the bill arrived, I couldn't help but feel it was a tad steep for the overall dining experience. In the end, while my visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles didn't entirely live up to my expectations, I left with a hopeful outlook. I'm confident that with a bit of attention to cleanliness and perhaps some tweaks to the menu, this charming spot has the potential to provide an even more delightful dining experience for its future guests.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMHJPSTh3RRAB,Cary,en,"Tangibility, Reliability",True,True,False,False,False

Their demeanor often comes across as rude, which has been consistently off-putting. Moreover, their ordering system, where they require a complete order before handing over the food, seems inefficient and unnecessary. This process would make more sense if there was an option to pre-pay to ensure the order matches the right customer. However, as it stands, it feels like an extra, pointless step that adds to the overall frustration.

The mansion features items imported from Cuba in the 1920s, adding to its cultural richness. Opting to park in the lot on Fenton Place rather than the one off Providence, especially the back parking lot, is advisable. The expansive patio offers a charming outdoor space, yet navigating the premises can be intricate, particularly when entering from the rear parking lot. Despite the establishment's reputation for its drinks and margaritas, the margarita experience fell short of expectations. It appears that my margarita (pitcher of Friend Zone) may have been non-alcoholic or contained minimal alcohol content. The perceived lack of value for the $42 expenditure is disappointing, as the drink resembled a mere juice consumption experience. I deeply regret not opting for the bottle of wine instead. The Billy Ray Valentine, however, proved to be exceptional. The enhanced queso dip, complimented by chorizo and sweet relish corn, was a culinary delight. The chicken fajitas (I'm Your Wingman), accompanied by cilantro lime rice, spring mix, queso, black beans, and sour cream, were a standout dish. Unfortunately, I was too full to indulge in the tres leches dessert, but it undoubtedly would have been delightful. The service provided by Adrianna was exemplary!

3264,"Very disappointing experience at this restaurant. My family was visiting from out of town and heard good things about this place. We walked in after spending the morning at the Dallas aquarium. We ordered a burger, wedge salad, hot dog, and chicken sandwich. It took about an hour for all our food to come out and at three separate times. My son’s burger was brought out first (by mistake from another table’s order) and our server ended up saying he could keep it and our food would be out shortly. About 20 minutes later by the time my son was finished my salad arrived. We were still missing my husband and daughter’s food. I went ahead and ate my salad and when I was finishing my lunch the rest of the food arrived. This was about 45 minutes after our order had been placed and the restaurant was not busy by any means. The hot dog had mustard on it which we had told the server to omit when we placed our order. When asked if we could get a new hot dog with just ketchup as originally ordered and keep the fries (our daughter was so hungry at this point) the server seemed annoyed. She brought us a new hot dog within a few minutes…drowning in ketchup, about 3 times the amount that was on the original hot dog, looking sloppy and gross overall. They were clearly annoyed we had requested a new one. This place has a fun overall bar atmosphere and an area for a live band.

Especially given the fact you have a menu to guide you and a specific measurement scoop to give the exact amount everytime.that is wrong and disrespectful in so many levels.look I get it it i really do sometimes you just may not have the right amount to make the proper portion of an item pulled or maybe just out of stock. But that don't mean that you can make a person believe that they will be getting what they ordered. All I got was a rice and cheese with red sauce burrito. you couldve just said we dont have that item available at this time not make people pay for it anyway. You took my money and just slapped crap into a tortilla knowing thats not at all what i paid for WRONG AND UNPROFESSIONAL.

We ordered various dishes and the presentation of the food was great. Abalone - This was good. Had a citrus taste to it. The price of this was discounted when we went (not sure if this will remain at a discounted price for future visits) Dragon Maki - Tasted good but nothing above and beyond. Comparable to any other sushi restaurant. Agedashi Tofu - This was good. Again, nothing above and beyond. Can get this anywhere and will be comparable. Takoyaki - Underwhelming. The bottom of the ball appeared to be flat. Tori Karaage - Underwhelming. Can get fried chicken anywhere. Lava Stone A5 Wagyu - The meat was tender but was tasteless. Portion size was really small and definitely not worth the $36. Better off getting 2-3 more rolls instead of this. Oyako Don - Underwhelming. Nothing stood out and you wont be missing out if you go anywhere else that offers this. Seafood Yaki Udon - This was good. The sauce was good. It wasnt too oily. Definitely above average for udon. Ice Cream - Complementary at the end. This was also good. Only had the options of matcha or vanilla.

4887,"Update: I’d say quality has gone down in the last two years they roll their injera and don’t put the platter for on the injera they place everything separate its like they’ve changed for the white population, injera is not the same and shiro quality has went down their portions are small as well. I really like this place as they offer alcohol and live music but I can say it’s no longer worth the hype. You can see the reviewed pictures of how the platters are placed on different plates when that’s not how it’s supposed to be served at all They’re priced a bit high for a new place, however their food is good, portions are a hit or miss. Sometimes they give you a decent portion other times they hide everything with injera and barely put any sauce in so I suggest checking before you leave. Their injera is good but their teff injera is okay. The restaurants atmosphere seems like they want to make it welcoming to Americans, which is good in Seattle. But their food also does not always seem authentic because of that, like they purposely make it less spicy. But they offer deli every and takeout later than any Ethiopian restaurant in Seattle so just by that they’re up points. Always friendly though and one of the few Ethiopian sports bars in Seattle that make it seem like they want everyone there (not my atmosphere I prefer Ethiopian/ Eritrean only) but hey in Seattle if you want your business to survive you adapt and I can respect that. I believe their chef is East African although I could not tell, she looked a bit Hispanic but she makes good food I was definitely a bit hesitant when I first went. They’re not my first choice but if Chefs Cafe or Kezira are closed then I will go here so definitely top 3 for Ethiopian restaurants although unlike Chefs and Kezira they do not offer Ayeb with your platter, not sure if it’s because it’s a veggie platter or what but their ayeb “house cheese” is priced pretty high at $3 but they do give you a good amount. If you’re an American wanting to try a new place that feels welcoming however still cultural, this is your place but if you’re habesha I suggest ordering to go.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjdlNWJ3EAE,Seattle,en,"Tangibility, Reliability, Empathy",True,True,True,False,False

At checkout the girl adds 18% tip to my purchase and tried to just skip through to have me sign. I'm staring at the handheld machine thinking, ""did she just put 18% on my order and not at least tell me??"" They get my food together and then she realizes she didn’t add my side of plantains I ordered. So it's going to be another $5. I watch her the second time and sure enough i see her pause and then quickly select the 18% again. So then i ask her. She said a bunch stuff that makes absolutely no sense ""it's going to charge you $5 so im fixing it…"" Sure. I finally look at her realizing she's not disclosing how shes pricing all of this and isn't going to tell me the truth. I get home, eat my side of plantains, they're what I wanted. I open up my plate and I'm dumbfounded. Half the plate is rice. I tried it, it was ok. I thought it was meant to be a side, but it was most of the styrofoam container. I try the mac n cheese. Meh…it was not worth the dairy issues to eat it (for me). My mom and I do make really good mac though, so I'm bougie lol. But the OXTAIL wad an afterthought!

6049,"While strolling the heart of Bourbon Street, stride into a world of refined elegance at Galatoire's in New Orleans, where over 100 years of tradition converge with exquisite culinary craftsmanship. From the moment you enter through its French doors, you are enveloped in an atmosphere of sophistication and old-world charm. You are treated to a dining experience that is both traditional and refined, a true celebration of Louisiana's rich culinary heritage*. Impeccable service and classic Creole dishes await each bite a testament to the restaurant's commitment to excellence. It is a place where tradition meets innovation and where every meal is an unforgettable celebration of food, family, and community. What I Tasted: The appetizer quartet showcased flavors from the indulgent crab maison to the crispy fried oysters. For the main course, fresh local sautéed fish adorned with seasonal crawfish Etouffée. The fish had a delicate yet rich flavor profile that melted in your mouth. The optional lemon caper beurre blanc sauce, with champagne, was the perfect complement to the fish, adding a velvety smoothness and subtle acidity and saltiness to each bite. Standout Feature: their unwavering dedication to preserving Creole traditions while infusing modern flair sets it apart. With every bite, you are transported to a bygone era of refined dining, where the vibrant culture of Louisiana comes to life. What Was Mid: While some may find the classic decor and attentive service charming, others may perceive it as slightly rigid or stuffy. It has all the qualities of rigid service, former attire, and feeling of exclusive clientele but without the real upscale elegance of refined dining elements However, whether the ambiance suits your taste is subjective and may depend on your dining preference. *If you are a guy do not forget your jacket it is one of the few places in town that does require one after 5:00",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqc1otVVNREAE,New Orleans,en,"Tangibility, Assurance",False,True,False,False,True
