38,"I’ve been here for lunch and dinner. Google restricts my review to one meal (at least for photos and menu items) but I’d love to share my experiences of both. My latest visit was for lunch. This is one of the most underrated lunch experiences in Atlanta. The atmosphere is light, airy, casual but elevated/sophisticated. Menu seems unassuming but has some absolute knockouts. Service was also just really enjoyable; I’m not much of a conversationalist but had Caroline at the bar and ended up having one of the best restaurant chats in recent memory, and was guided through the menu for an awesome selection of the omelette, sticky toffee pudding, and coffee. Dinners are more intimate, and a little hard to get a reservation so it’s been tough for my schedule. Unsure how a group reservation would go but can vouch for solo trips and dates, or close 1:1 catch ups. Despite the reservation struggles, I appreciate the smaller seating capacity and streamlined menu. I suppose I’d like more small bite options to pair with the wine because I always end up getting the Jamón Ibérico and would like more meats, but that’s knit pick. I’ll end with a confirmation that the book store element is not a gimmick and not aesthetics only - the curation is so well done. I’ve gotten 5 books as gifts and 2 for myself. Really appreciate this spot. Atlanta could use more spaces like this that execute on the actual food experience as well as they do in the creativity and vibe.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkX3N5MnpnRRAB,Atlanta,en,"Tangibility, Empathy",False,True,True,False,False

71,"Having tried thoroughly enjoyed our omakase experiences at Mujo and Hiyakawa we have been trying to find other similar experiences in Atlanta. I am happy to report that Brush's omakase did not disappoint. The service was outstanding. Both the servers and the chef spent generous amounts of time talking with us and making sure we had everything we needed/wanted. We did the 16 course menu and it was the perfect amount a food and I would say it is a better value when compared to Mujo or Hiyakawa. I would say the atmosphere sits in between those two. Mujo having a very chill comfortable vibe and Hiyakawa being more like a museum and culinary course. At Brush you get a more chill vibe and can get as little or as much information you want to the meal. I would also say that Brush is much less overbearing on the rules than either Mujo and Hiyakawa which was very nice. The quality of the fish and dishes were amazing. Brush has a unique rice and some unique presentations that the other places don't have. All things considered I think Brush my be the best overall place (accounting for price, comfort and experience). The only draw back of the omakase experience for me is the the space in not an intimate as the other spots I have mentioned.

244,"Taqueria definition: a Mexican restaurant specializing in tacos. As a mexican, I felt out of place at this taqueria because it is NOT AUTHENTIC. This is basically a locally owned On the Border / La Frontera Grill. The food isn't the worst but far from flavorful. Even the cashier said, ""Were a boring Taqueria"" My husband hates these types of places because they profit/benefit from the name 'Taqueria' when the flavor/authenticity isn't there. It's cultural appropriation, but I'm sure it's okay since some of the workers were Hispanic, and 1 co-Founder is Mexican. But the main guy is Mike Klank, a white American. It saddens me that Mr. Hernandez has accepted to Americanize our Mexican culture for financial gain. It's altered to fit the demographic they're looking for. The same thing is happening in Mexico. I understand that, but its not right. Its white-washed. Health inspection was an 86 B. No onions or cilantro on the tacos. Tacos are made with flour tortillas, not corn. No salsa bar. Enchilada is $4 each, and it looked like vomit. The chicken it had was rotisserie chicken. Canned beer was $5 each. Guac was the only decent thing there. We took the food to go, adding a 5% fee.

Her advice was that we should have made a reservation by contacting the owner directly. So, if you find yourself waiting for a table here, just know that the empty table you see through the window may just remain empty until a limo full of people with a secret reservation arrives for their 8:15 reservation. Easy fix: instead of leading on to your customers that they are the third ones in line for a table, tell them the truth (we have some large parties tonight, special event or request, etc).

3716,I rated this place low unfortunately because of a disrespectful lying manager (Hispanic decent) and her disrespectful co-worker (white lady who thinks she is black). I mentioned their race for a reason. I had a pick up order. Grabbed my food and opened the bag to see if the fries was cold because order was done at 3:00 I walked in at 3:06. While opening the bag the employee was giving me a dirty look so I said I’m just trying to see if my fries are hot. She then says you good we just put it up there. I continued with checking and just as I thought they were cold. I POLITELY said ma’am may I please have a fresh order of fries. She rolled her eyes and said they are fresh. I politely said no they are not. She takes the fries I take a seat. The manager comes over and says they can’t give me fresh fries because the order was fine. I tell the manager I just tasted it and it’s cold and since I paid for it want them hot. The manger continues to be defiant and disrespectful. I said I’m not leaving without hot fries. The employee brings new fries (I’m sure she just redropped but whatever I don’t care they hot. I ask for DM manger number. They gave a card. I go to the car call the number and the manger who I just got into it with answered. Now this lady lied and assured me it was the right number. All of this was unnecessary and stupid. They only had to give me fresh fries that’s it. Turned into a real situation and if I wasn’t smart with self control things could have went left. I’m still going to file that complaint!

We had the caesar salad, bacon & french onion soup, I love me some french onion soup and this one was good and their frida cocktail was delicious.

Upon arrival I met the cashier. Her service was OK. I ordered the crabcake, a small gumbo and a cold pressed orange juice. I was really excited about the food as I haven’t had any good vegan food since I visited New Orleans. A lot of the restaurants that I wanted to visit were closed or had closed early. I first tried the gumbo and it was OK. I wish that it had more rice, vegetables and mushrooms. I don’t know if this is the correct way to describe it, but it was very loose and not very thick. The next thing I tried was the crabcake and it was OK. If it were not for the sauce I don’t think it would’ve been that great. The orange juice however was pretty good. Overall with tip I spent about $40. The crabcake alone was $10. My suggestion is that For $10 you should get two crabcakes and the gumbo should be thicker maybe add some more vegetables, mushrooms and rice I left feeling unsatisfied.

Then, after over a 25 min wait including us promoting the bartender to check, I had spaghetti fra diavolo. I expect a little spice in fra diavolo, but it was pure black pepper that I tasted. No tomato, chili, basil or lemon. The shrimp were rubbery to boot. Did not finish. And we had paesano potatoes. The Parmesan was past the point of melting to nearly burnt on, there was no rosemary or garlic flavor. It didn’t even taste like it had salt or pepper (maybe they ran out after the spaghetti…). And to top it off, the service was not good. We had to prompt them to check for our food after we had been sitting for 25 min.

I had the fried porkchops with candied yams and potato salad. The porkchops were humongous compared to what I'm used to and they were fried perfectly. The candied yams and mashed potato salad were both addictive. The hubby had the seafood pasta, fried fish, and jambalaya. The pasta sauce was flavorful, but he was sad there wasn't more crab that was noticeable. However he did love the jambalaya and wished he had gotten a double helping of it instead of a salad.

6545,"Located in the heart of Lakeview, Russell’s Marina Diner stands as a cherished beacon of New Orleans’ rich culinary tradition. Since its inception in 1985, this diner has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to destination for exceptional breakfasts, weaving itself into the fabric of the city’s dining scene. With a menu that spans the gamut from indulgent fried chicken and waffles to a diverse array of egg specialties, Russell’s caters to a broad spectrum of tastes. Not forgetting the health-conscious, the diner also offers lighter fare such as eggwhite omelets and sweet potato pancakes, ensuring that every patron leaves satisfied. The dining experience is further enhanced by the option to enjoy your meal either inside the diner’s cozy interior, at the counter where the local vibe thrives, in their inviting dining room, or outside on the pet-friendly patio, making it perfect for every occasion. During my visit, I decided to try the legendary Egg Saints #33—a daring concoction that perfectly embodies New Orleans’ flair for culinary innovation. This dish features a grilled biscuit topped with alligator sausage, grilled tomatoes, poached eggs, and smothered in homemade country gravy. Each component of the dish harmonizes to create a breakfast experience that is both unique and profoundly satisfying. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with the diner’s unmistakable local charm, enhanced by the friendly service that made me feel right at home. The ambiance, a blend of the cozy and the communal, set the perfect stage for what was to be an unforgettable meal. The Premier League playing softly in the background added a touch of camaraderie, reminiscent of a neighborhood café where everyone is welcome. The highlight of my visit was, without a doubt, the food. The Egg Saints #33 was a revelation, transforming the classic eggs Benedict into a dish that captivated my palate and left me pondering the culinary prowess behind it. Every bite was a testament to Russell’s commitment to quality and innovation, making it clear why this diner holds a special place in the hearts of New Orleans’ residents and visitors alike. In a city lauded for its vibrant food scene, claiming the title of ""best breakfast"" is no small feat. Yet, as I left Russell’s Marina Diner, I was already yearning to return and dive deeper into their menu.
