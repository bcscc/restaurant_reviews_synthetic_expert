While the service and environment did not disappoint, the food did. It all tasted pretty good, and presented nicely, however the portion sizes were appalling for the prices. The server said the plates are meant to be shared, so we ordered more dishes than we originally intended to. But when you order a plate for $45 and only get three Brussels sprouts to “share,” you feel robbed.

Although it is marketed to be a book store, you can't really look at the books and you're not allowed your laptops at the bar in the case you want to have a drink and work. The hostess wasn't going to seat me at first and then decided she did have an empty seat at the bar for a couple hours and I felt a bit of judgement passed since I was alone. And on that note, bar requires reservations. Food was mediocre and overpriced. It just ultimately seemed like based on how you were dressed and how you looked, you may get better service than others.

3202,"I visited Grill and Vine at the Westin Downtown Dallas and had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The food and menu items were subpar, my server didn’t know in-depth about any items on the menu, but those things were not a big deal. When my check comes for $220, I give my card and the server comes back saying that only $160 was deducted and that I still owe the additional $60. So I check my account, things are all good so I give back my card to charge the rest. They then charge me an additional $180 and are saying I still owe more money. Seeing that I’ve already been charged $340 for a $220 bill I immediately go to the manager bc it makes no sense whatsoever. The manager proceeds to tell me that the card reader automatically charged the amount of $180 and he doesn’t know why. In what world does a card reader charge random amounts? You would have to type in the amount owed to be charged. While trying to see what’s going on and get my money back, Louis Almassy comes over and immediately tells me to calm down, calls me aggressive, and threatens to call the authorities on me without even knowing what’s going on or why I’m upset about being overcharged. He continued to call me aggressive and threatened to call the cops on me all for being upset about money being taken from me. I didn’t appreciate being called names and being threatened with cops for simply just calling out being overcharged. I truly believe that I was only threatened with the cops being called because I’m black as there was nothing happening that warranted a cop being involved when again, money was taken from ME. Louis saw a black man upset and immediately pegged me as the problem without even getting an understanding of the situation. Even after getting an understanding, he never apologized for threatening to call the cops. Furthermore, Louis is a loss prevention manager which “protects a company's assets from fraud and theft”, why would I be reprimanded by him when I’m the one in need of help?

Tonight 12/24/19 I stopped by for a sushi dinner and shrimp shumai. When I got home I had sashimi, with brown rice in a plastic container. The shumai was the only thing they got right. Partially my fault for not checking it first. I have changed from 5 to two stars. Gave them one more try. That's the last picture I posted. That eel at the bottom of the photo. It was rubbery, very rubbery. I'm pretty sure it also has to do with the location. You're probably going to find quality sushi at a place you're spending top dollar. I will not choose Saki II next time. Or just take a train ride to 51st in Manhattan to Nippori. I need to add that even though their sushi is not up to standards, I have never tried anything from their cooked menu. Good luck 5/14/22 I have to commend you on your latest maki and sushi, because it was very flavorful and fresh, but hold on and take a close look at the fake lobster that came in your seafood delight. Unbelievable! Do you really think that passes for lobster? I thought that I would give the cooked menu a try and you shock me with this!

I speak for the whole table when I say the overall service was subpar for the price, we each spent $50-100 to only have water filled once, if that, and a hefty wait in between ordering, receiving food, and checks. My check was also incorrect which ended up costing an extra 15 mins to fix that. Food was ok, but it’s not worth the languishing service attitude and several mistakes on the orders. All in all, we were out a little after 9 and exhausted as we have to work each day starting at 6am. Likely won’t be back unless it’s room service or bar food. Edit: I genuinely didn’t expect this review to carry any weight in the world at all, not even in the slightest. I assumed it would get lost within all reviews never to be seen again. But within hours of me posting the hotel set out to make it right which is crazy. Also, I didn’t realize the hotel is so involved with the restaurant or even cared what went on in it!

I'm a bit of a simpleton and prefer simple food cooked well. The offerings here are a lot of things, simple isn't one of them. After a bit of a stand off, the server departed in a huff with our order. The appetizers were good, but like everything else there is just too much going on for me. Too many flavors competing on your tongue. Eventually we ordered gumbo and a caprese salad. The gumbo was simply okay. I had had a significantly better cup of gumbo at a popular restaurant in bucktown the night before. In addition there was a very slight fishy taste to the gumbo telling me it wasn't the freshest thing in the world. The caprese salad was fine except for the balsamic vinegar, which was the refined version that is sweet. Typically the refined is put on ice cream and such.
