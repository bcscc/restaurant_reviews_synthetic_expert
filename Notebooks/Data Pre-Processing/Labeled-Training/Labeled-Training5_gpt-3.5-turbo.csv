Even though this place isn't entirely vegan, there are enough options that it'll make most vegans very happy. I ordered the Saffron and Lobster Mushroom Risotto and the Madison cocktail. The Risotto consisted of arborio rice, saffron, and lobster mushrooms among other ingredients. It didn't taste overly indulgent or heavily sweet or savory, rather it just had a very complimentary combination of flavors and a great texture which didn't warrant extra sugar or salt. I love it when menu items don't taste overly greasy or rich and they have a cleaner vibe about them. The Risotto was accompanied with a minimalist Arugula salad with a great lemon vinaigrette. So simple, yet clean. Good dishes don't need a million ingredients, just a handful of quality ones.

4976,"TLDR: Busy casual spot, with an Americanized twist to Vietnamese food. Non-Vietnamese waiters do not know their menu. Food is edible. I came in with a party of 8 Vietnamese some tourists and some local to Virginia. We were greeted promptly and politely from the waitress. Since there were 8 of us, a lot of menu items were ordered, which included egg rolls, spring rolls, rice, pho, and a vegetarian dish. The menu itself is very beautiful, but the actual food definitely looks nothing like what is pictured. The service: Our waitress was very nice, took our order, and repeated it to us. The appetizers came out within 10 minutes, but the main entrees came out, no exaggeration, 45 minutes later. I asked for extra beansprouts, as the existing amount they gave was enough for ants, and later on found out that they gave the entire table extra and charged for it. This would have been nice to know beforehand that this would be extra, which definitely was not the case. We also ordered a banh mi, but after over an hour, we told them not to bring it, as it was taking too long. Our drinks were full, but had to politely ask them for it. The food: The food all came out at sporadic times, with the children's food coming out 1 hour after the appetizers, again, no exaggeration. Given the restaurant's name, half of the table decided to order pho, and our waitress got it all wrong. We ordered the ""Pho Tai Nam"" and got the ""Pho Tai Lan"" My table being Vietnamese, pronouncing it correctly, thought that this non-Vietnamese waitress was pronouncing it incorrectly but giving us the correct order. Upon the first 2-3 bites, we were certain that we did not order this entr√©e, and asked the waitress and manager what this was? They kept repeating ""Pho Tai Lan"" and we were like this does not seem right. Anyways, I found a menu on another table that hadn't been pre-bussed in about an hour, and went through it. Saw that they had both a ""Pho Tai Nam"" and a ""Pho Tai Lan"" (For the record, there is no such thing as ""Pho Tai Lan"" so be aware that this proprietary to the restaurant. This is essentially beef pho with the beef being stir-fried with garlic and topped on the pho. sounds good but the beef was over-cooked and tough) Message to the non-Vietnamese waitress: Please double check with your Vietnamese patrons on their Vietnamese order using your menu. Management: Management was a Vietnamese kid who spoke very softly and decided to give us 50% off of two bowls of pho (there were 4 total on our table), which was nice. We spoke to him in Vietnamese throughout our time in the restaurant to get things sorted out, but he was so timid and not confident in his communication. Not much got resolved. Conclusion: This restaurant is definitely catered more to Americans who would like to get a basic feel on what Vietnamese food is. The food is mediocre, at best, but maybe this restaurant is catering to the area. Pho Viet USA is a casual spot, with a fancy menu, and a poor food presentation. The prices are high, a little too high, given the food presentation, taste, service, and restaurant ambiance. Would I go back? No. Would I suggest this to an American? Yes. Vietnamese?

5086,"Solid Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas topped with a variety of fresh ingredients and perfect for a relatively tasty, quick, and affordable meal. The concept is pretty similar to CAVA -- you can either build your own by choosing a base, main, and toppings, or you can pick from one of their chef-curated options. I usually opt to build my own with their salmon fillet or roasted butternut squash over kale, and topped with all the veggies and hummus. All of their veggies are super fresh, and their sauces all pack a ton of flavor (watch out for the spicy ones -- they actually are quite spicy). Their salmon fillets tend to be very small and a touch dry, as I assume they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, but they still pack a good flavor. Although the food is solid, it's generally not my first choice for fast-casual Mediterranean fare, as (1) they're not always aware of which allergens are in their food, and (2) despite being a fast-casual spot, service can often be quite delayed. Starting with the first -- the staff is wonderful at handling dietary restrictions; they'll put on new gloves, make sure your order is on a clean service (i.e., new foil or bowl), and avoid working on other orders at the same time as yours. However, I'm worried they haven't been told what all the allergens are in all of their ingredients. For example, I've received their gluten-free falafel pita box at several catered office lunches, and, unfortunately, ended up feeling pretty sick afterwards. Although I appreciate that they have a gluten-free pita (although it does taste pretty dismal) and that they have gluten-free options for desserts and sides, I don't believe their falafel is gluten-free (or maybe it's something in the rice or one of the toppings...I'm not entirely sure what it is or if there's just some cross-contamination, but something in those boxes definitely isn't sitting right with me). Beyond dietary restrictions, the only other drawback to Roti is that it's not always as speedy as advertised, which is not at all the fault of the employees. Every time I go in, there are usually only 1-2 people working the entire restaurant, fielding a slew of both in-person and mobile orders. This naturally creates a delay in getting out all orders; for example, I'll sometimes wait upwards of 30+ min. for a line of five or so in-person customers because the staff is so swamped with mobile orders. On the flip side, if you get a mobile order, definitely go to pick it up instead of using their delivery service (which includes third-party apps like UberEats, as Roti opts to use their own drivers for those services). I usually have to wait over 45 min. for a delivery order, despite the quoted wait time of 15 min. and that my apartment is less than 2 miles away from the restaurant. All in all, I think Roti is a solid place for fresh, flavor-packed Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas.

It was an innovative way to approach this classic pastry. My only critique is the custard on top was so good I wanted more. Very light, fresh, and balanced melody of flavors. The consistency was reminiscent of a fusion between a scone and puff pastry. You can tell the French invited fries by how well the fries here complimented every dish.

5964,"We visited Blue Bayou later in the evening when we were out looking for an after dinner drink and some dessert. The atmosphere looked inviting, and a quick review of their sidewalk menu lead us to believe we had found the place. There weren‚Äôt many people in the restaurant but the bartender looked like a ball of frenetic energy. She was running around and asked us if we had been waited on yet, we said no and then she rushed away. A few minutes later, an engaging server stopped by and took our order. We ordered two desserts and four drinks. The desserts arrived long before the drinks and were not as shown in the menu. The menu describes a large slice of banana fosters cheesecake topped with sliced bananas and whipped cream. We received a sliver of cheesecake with no bananas. The sliver wasn‚Äôt enough for two. Three of our four drinks arrived after we finished our desserts, one drink was MIA. Mine was supposed to have rum in it but I couldn‚Äôt taste any. I chalked that up to the nutmeg on top. Another drink was supposed to be a lemon drop and tasted like water and lemon. We knew, with 100% certainty that the drinks were heavily watered down when the fourth drink finally arrived. It was supposed to be one of their signature drinks, an Old Fashioned. What is typically a beautiful dark caramel liquid, with a small amount of ice, dark cherry, bitters, sugar or simple syrup and maybe an orange slice came out looking like a slightly beige glass of water with a maraschino cherry and filled to the brim with ice. It was so watered down that the bourbon was hardly detectable. No simple syrup or sugar was used. And the bitters that make an OF so special were missing as well.

The pastas were bland and my marinara pasta had a pool of water on the bottom. The sandwiches were not any better. They were salty, chewy and had an uneven texture. To add on, after the span of 5 seconds, the gravy from the roast beef quickly transferred to the bread and made it extremely soggy. Hence adding to its uneven texture. Not only that, the plates were dirty. The restaurant was also unable to record their orders properly, thus leaving my friends to starve and suffer as they watched everyone else eat. My friends and I then checked the reviews on the restaurants. They talked about recent food poisoning, and other liabilities. As soon as we read these reviews, it became clear that they were true.

We have been multiple times in the past and the food has been great, and staff so friendly but unfortunately not this time. When arriving, there was an African American female hostess with glasses. Multiple tables were open but she told us we would have to wait for a 2 top table to be cleaned.

When we told the couple behind us of what happened, they also left the location and the hostess continued to smirk about her decision to treat us as she had. I made the mistake of calling the Lakefront location, instead of the French Quarter, and spoke to the supervisor. She was appalled by the fact an employee of Felix‚Äôs would treat customers as we were treated. She said the situation was totally mishandled and if it had been her location, she would have marched up front and made the situation right. She also recommended I write this review to advise the owner of what had happened.
