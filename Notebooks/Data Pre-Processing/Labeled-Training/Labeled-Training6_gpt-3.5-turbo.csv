2298,"I have been to this Chick-fil-A four or five times since it opened about four months ago, and the experience has improved each time! They have a mostly brand new staff that is still learning, but the extremely negative tone of the reviews shared here does not match the quality of experiences I‚Äôve had - The food was delicious, the staff was professional and attentive, the service was excellent and the store was clean! As a former employee, I know Chick-fil-A has set the customer service bar high for its customers, and with this being a new location they certainly have room to grow in speed, accuracy and efficiency. However, to go a step further and demonize the community surrounding the store (as many reviews have done) is too far. As you all know, Chick-fil-A traditionally operates stores in more affluent/middle class communities, and this particular store is located right on the boundary line between a high poverty neighborhood and a very affluent neighborhood in Charlotte. I can‚Äôt help but think this unique reality unfairly contributes to people‚Äôs perception of the store and its employees if the quality of service isn‚Äôt at the high standard they expect it to be. In addition to providing great food and good service to customers, this store also provides over a hundred people with stable, high quality employment within walking distance of their homes. I‚Äôm not sure how many employees live in the community surrounding the store, but having employment options walkable to lower income residents is super rare in car-dependent cities like Charlotte, and it‚Äôs worth being excited about! So don‚Äôt let these reviews keep you from giving this location a shot. Cut them some slack and give them some time to train their employees and develop them. And if the drive through line is long, park and walk in - 9 out of 10 times it‚Äôs faster anyway.

2367,"Atmosphere: 5 Food: 4 Service: 2.5 I was looking for a place to take my boyfriend for a celebration dinner, and this place had such a cool vibe on the pictures online and we love Asian food. The location is at a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking, and I promise the inside looks nicer than the outside. The inside is cool and modern, and the pictures of the lady on the wall look like my mom when she younger lol. We came on a Wednesday evening and there was plenty of seating indoor, and at the bar, but we opted for outdoor seating since it was so nice out. I also saw a sign for a great happy hour deal, so I'll have to come back one day. Let's start with the food. We ordered the Golden roll, and the pork belly buns, and both were delicious! For my entree, I had a Thai noodle dish that was extremely flavorful, while my boyfriend got the Korean rice bowl, which was not bad but not quite to the standard of the other dishes in our opinion. Our service was not fantastic and was the only downside of our meal. Although our server was ok, she was a little crass and borderline curt, something that I would expect from a local dive bar, but not a nicer place like this. At first I chalked it up to her being young and similar in age to us so she might have been more informal to be relatable, but at the end when we asked for the check, I wasn't sure if I had finished my meal enough to need a box. She said that she was either bring a box now or not coming back, which I thought was a little rude and out of nowhere. Of course she never came back to check on us after that either even though we were still dining for another 20 minutes. It was just a sour way to end an otherwise nice dinner for a special occasion. I was also shocked and a little offended to see a 30% tip option. Tipping has gone out of control and the guilt of selecting a more reasonable tip amount puts customers in an uncomfortable place, especially when the service was not great. I'd love to come back to try more of the menu because we had a nice experience in terms of the food and atmosphere, but I would hope to have a different server if I were to come back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENzRuTkFREAE,Charlotte,en,"Tangibility, Responsiveness",False,True,False,True,False

Lol The meatballs looked and tasted like they were frozen from a bag. The sauce was alright though. Bread and ‚Äúgreat olive oil‚Äù was far from great. The Caesar was dry, and had 1 little anchovy on it. Pizza was ok. The cacio e Pepe was wayyyyy undercooked and the cheese clumped (cheap ingredients) And all of it was definitely overpriced for the quality.

When I got to the restaurant my food was packed and ready to go and the cashier was happy to add a drink for me. The atmosphere when I entered was very in line with their sign saying they'd been open since 1933. The lighting was perfect. Everything was clean and I'd say half of your meal was the experience of eating there. We got a burger with onion rings, chicken tenders with fries, and quesadillas with sweet potato fries, and two cheeseburger sliders. The total was about $70. So about $15 per meal and $10 for the sliders. Which is pretty much in line with food from a restaurant these days. I enjoyed my sweet potato fries. I did need to add a little salt. My quesadilla was enjoyable but not great. I would ask for the salsa and sour cream to be separate because they were together. It also could have been crispier and had more than just cheese and chicken. I did ask for chicken and steak but it was just chicken. My mother-in-law enjoyed her cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, Swiss cheese and mushrooms. She enjoyed her meal and ate her leftovers. My husband got chicken tenders with fries. The fries he called ok. He didn't eat them all and didn't finish them later. We did hear them up and they would have been better fresh I think. There were a lot of tenders about six. They were thin for restaurant tenders and my husband said they were over cooked. He called them passable but did eat the rest later so they were edible. We got onions that nobody ate. They looked a little burnt. The sliders were your common sliders they weren't anything special but they were cooked well.

Five of the people were satisfied with their meal, but my daughter and I ordered the kale and quinoa salad, which was extremely sparse. It had virtually no quinoa, possibly one cut up apricot and one cut up cucumber and dressing that was advertised as curry, but tasted like pure oil. The kale was very hard and inedible. Each of us was charged $16 for our salads which amounted to $32. We were both extremely disappointed and upset but were hosting guests from out of town and did not want to complain or have to wait 20 minutes for new dinners if we ordered them. It was already a long wait to get our food originally. I am extremely upset and no one is getting back to me from management. My voicemail is sitting ignored. I offered to scan and send a copy of our receipt so they could give me a refund which be would be a small portion of what we spent I am looking for a refund for those two salads .Wish me luck.

3203,"I booked this venue for Valentine‚Äôs Day with my wife. $85 per person is reasonable so I booked it. We were greeted promptly and politely by the hostess. The restaurant was basically empty, which made me wonder why the booking time was so limited. It took a few minutes to be greeted and offered drinks, but the bar was busy so we understood. When we placed our order, we watched our drinks sit on the bar for 8 minutes before my wife got up and got them for us. When it came time to order from the fixed menu, I was concerned when they didn‚Äôt ask what temperature I wanted my filet. Come to find out, it‚Äôs only well done. They brought out my plate with mushrooms, some sort of potato, and a thin filet cooked WELL DONE. It was painfully obvious the steak was premade and microwaved to order. My wife got scallops and risotto, the scallops had a strong fishy smell to them, which is NOT in the norm. I sent my steak back to be prepared medium rare as a filet should be. The product they returned to me was BLUE RARE at best. At this point, I was annoyed. So I asked them to return the food and bring us our check. I gladly paid for my wife‚Äôs meal since she tolerated the scallops. The oxtail pie appetizer was bland, and the cappuccino tomato soup starter was good, but was maybe an ounce. To top it off, they brought h wife her dessert and sent back mine since I returned my meal, and requested it to be removed (I took one bite of my well done steak). While I understand they shouldn‚Äôt just hand stuff out, they should have at least made an effort to remedy the poor food quality. I don‚Äôt blame the server at all. Either way, I paid $113 for my wife‚Äôs meal that was mediocre at best. The risotto was bland and overcooked along with the overly fishy scallops. I hope management fixes this for future diners.

Let's just say our Easter celebration went from holy to ""holy moly, this place is bad!"" Reservations Don't Mean Reservations Despite having a reservation, our party of ten (including restless kids) waited a soul-crushing **hour and a half** for our food. By the time it arrived, we were famished and past the point of polite conversation. A Sticky Situation (Literally) A quick trip to the men's room did little to improve our mood. The floor was a disgusting tribute to those who came before us, leaving a lingering question about the overall cleanliness of the establishment. Food? More Like a Food Quest The agonizing wait for our entrees wasn't the end of the saga. After finally getting our food, it took another **45 minutes** just to receive a measly dessert. Apparently, patience is a key ingredient at Henry's Majestic, because you'll need it in biblical proportions. The Kitchen Gods Said ""No"" to My Friend's Meal One member of our party never even received their dinner! Two whole hours vanished, and poof, no food appeared. The waiter's excuse of a ""busy Easter rush"" was laughable considering we had reservations. Shouldn't they have been prepared for a holiday crowd? The Service? Non-Existent Our waiter, Sam, tried his best, but it wasn't enough to salvage this disaster. There were no apologies, no attempt to fix the situation, just an acceptance of defeat.

4553,"My recent experience at Lemonade Restaurant left much to be desired, and various factors contributed to an overall lackluster visit. The food, including the chicken breast and salmon dishes, fell short of expectations, with a notable lack of flavor and a disappointingly dry texture. It was evident that the kitchen may have overlooked crucial elements that elevate a dining experience. Adding to the disappointment was the sparse crowd; we were the only patrons at 7 pm on a Saturday night. This near-empty atmosphere was further highlighted by the visible departure of several potential diners who seemed unimpressed with the offerings. The lack of a bustling ambiance raised concerns about the restaurant's appeal and left us questioning our choice for the evening. Unfortunately, the service didn't manage to salvage the experience. The servers appeared disinterested and failed to provide the helpful and attentive service one expects in a dining setting. On a slightly positive note, the lemonade drinks offered a modest reprieve, providing a decent refreshment. However, they were not enough to counterbalance the subpar food and lackluster service.

No one ever came to get us after said would just be a few minutes . We headed back up to hostess desk after waiting for amount of time we were told. We stood another couple minutes in the line near hostess desk and were finally called. The hostess desk is very unorganized and whole reservation system is very poorly managed. We headed to our table at 05:50 we didn‚Äôt get waited on until 06:20 and this was after several waiters walked by and the large table behind us sat after us and got waited on before us . We waited over an hour for our food and we had to have someone from our table go to host desk and inquire about order because our waitress disappeared. She then came by table after inquiring about order and told our ticket was up next it was an hour and ten minutes to get four entrees. I understand delays happen but your staff shows no care or concern . We talked to ‚Äúkitchen manager ‚Äú and host at desk and they showed no concern. No manager ever came by table to check in which is so bizarre . After stating how long waited for food the waitress said can offer dessert on the house. After one of us said just take their one entree off before we got food, she had to realize we waited too long. At this point we just wanted to leave it was ridiculous it took that long as other people that sat after us and only had 2-5 people in party and had over 5 tables around us that got food before us. This establishment is severely lacking in customer service, hospitality and atmosphere. Stay away unless you want to have bad dining experience and poor customer service.

This time we were told the bar area was full (even though there were clearly empty tables) so we were led into the secondary dining area and it's a whole different world and not for us. We didn't order wine and my wife wasn't too hungry so only ordered a salad and a side dish, and the waitress didn't seem to be happy about that and didn't pay much attention to us. Also the bar area is calm and laid back but both dining are as loud as a high school cafeteria and for some reason no one even tries to keep their voices down. We could clearly identify voices from multiple tables across the room and it seemed to be normal. When my drink was gone she took it away and didn't ask if I wanted another.
