"The food was good but the service was sub par. The poor young waitress was the only person working during lunch, she was very slow with our order, she messed up a lot, and we got our appetizers at the same time as the meal not before. I feel like if she had more help the experience would have been much better but the food was good.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5b3RfQmZBEAE,New Orleans,en,6067
"This place is garbage.  Ordered a tray of party wings for my son's birthday and the wings we picked up were black like fried in very used old oil.  The wings were soggy and tasted like old grease used to fry other food items from last week or last month!
I highly do not recommend this place for catering or for eating.   Always check your food because these culprits think they can get away with whatever they want.  You shouldn't mess with people's food if you do not want bad things said about your measly restaurant.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwdFpuX3hBRRAB,San Francisco,en,4713
The service was AWESOME!!! The staff was also very attractive. Food was delicious. Music and decor are just right. I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out. I'll definitely be back.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0a0lUdFJnEAE,Washington,en,5081
"Little Joe's has consistently made the best pizza in San Francisco, we order delivery every so often and are always delighted by the quality of their food.

"The best food we had in New Orleans. After consolidating that we were not fans of Creole cuisine, we decided to give it a last shot in this place, given the high ratings. It did not disappoint. I had the shrimps and grits and my husband the Alfredo pasta and they both were delicious. The prawns well marinated in the creole sauce, the grits perfectly cooked in cheese and the side biscuit was to die for. Even our server was lovely and we did not have to wait for food, which arrived within 5-10 minutes. Such a shame it was our last night, otherwise we would have come back",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcnJQUXNRRRAB,New Orleans,en,5841
"Came to subway yesterday. An asian kid was behind the counter. This guy all of a sudden says, ‚Äúwould you like to box with me for a free sandwich‚Äù, made a boxing gesture to me, and then proceeded to say ‚Äúwe dont condone violence over here‚Äù confidently. It left me in a shock and i snubbed him.

What kind of lunatic hires this subway is making here? Why are you hiring psychos? If this guy is saying that we dont condone violence over here, Is this something that the owner has given guidelines or turned a blind eye to? This was the weirdest experience that I have ever had. You come to eat a meal and some purposeless rando asks you to fight with them.

To this kid, give yourself 10 years, when your male hormones will subside, I would love to check with you if you still want to fight with random strangers and go bankrupt paying settlements.

Btw if the owner doesnt apologize for this, I am going to send the email up the subway mgmt chain. Lets see now how much would this rando cashier would like to box with future customers. This is a lawsuit in making.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaN1BTeHlnRRAB,Cary,en,2211
"Caution, foul language ahead! The Mac n cheese pot roast was fn delicious!

When I travel for work I like to find local food that I can't just get anywhere. Saw this place, saw the Mac n cheese pot roast, and knew that's just what this old fat guy needs!

The place was cozy and the staff was awesome. The prices seemed fair for the area. Things in the Northeast are more 'spensive than they are in the deep south where I'm from.

I definitely recommend Sloane's if you're in the area and get the chance to go. Kudos!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0dGZERWd3RRAB,Boston,en,1122

"The food at Brennan's was beyond outstanding. We tried a variety of appetizers, entrees and a dessert and everything was elegant and delicious. The atmosphere was up scale and unique and added to the overall experience. Our server was very nice but the service was a bit slow. Overall we were there for 2 hours for brunch.

The girl that takes the orders has the absolute worst attitude - she acts like she‚Äôs paying for the food. The food is rushed and tasteless. She must be related to the owner because she has a real entitled attitude towards patrons. If she feels she is beneath the community she serves this is not the place for her or the establishment.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxd0t5TjNRRRAB,Boston,en,1240

"Just an update they charged the card about 3 times in the end and we had to dispute, no apology for trying to charge us almost $300 . All the locals will tell you to avoid these places i agree, ask for local favorites and take an uber or wall or trolly all easy and fun.  Get your souvenirs from the french quarter not your food, eat local.  Edited review since we left and came home after checking the credit card not only did they build us twice for the wrong dinner that was 2 times as much money as our meal was but they also charged us for a meal as well Do not go here they will rip you off and they assured us that our credit card was going to get fixed.......  If you want good food there are so many places outside of the French quarter go to magazine street go to city center go to garden district anywhere but the French quarter right now.....This was my first review after leaving that evening and being told R meal was going to get charged correctly.....Food was ok per french quarter standards and have us wrong bill and the run around when they took another card for our meal, not ok. Your better off at popeyes",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcU0tRFd3EAE,New Orleans,en,5354

"I got two things, the jerk chicken (dark meat) and the oxtail. I got sides of rice, plantains, and salad. I also got coco bread.
Wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the jerk chicken to be honest, but that‚Äôs just my personal taste. The oxtail was absolutely delicious, the sauce was super flavorful, dipping the coco bread in it was an absolute 10/10. mixed with the rice was also gas. The ladies in there were super nice too, got me everything i needed, i almost forgot my coco bread but they caught me after i left and made sure i got it",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGcl9USEp3EAE,Washington,en,5281

"Brixx is definitely a good way to go if you are craving a bit of everything.  This one is located in Dilworth, and it is on the smaller side from their parking to seating inside. It can get crowded. We went on a Friday right at 5pm, and it was still empty, and thankfully so as there were 8 of us. Everything was great in the beginning. Our drinks, appetizers, and food were delivered in a timely manner. Towards the middle of us bring there the dinner crowd did come rushing in which caused our waitress to I believe get fairly overwhelmed. We basically had to hunt her down for everything, straws, refills, cream, and sugar for coffee and even utensils. At one point, we just didn't feel like having to call her over or even wait any longer that we just decided to op out of ordering anything else and just leave. The food, though, was amazing as always. We ordered their Bruschetta, Buffalo, and oven roasted wings, spinach and artichoke dip with piano bread, Ceasars salads, penne pasta and it was all DELICIOUS! it's not a bad spot for food, but maybe this location just wasn't the best.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREejlxS1h3EAE,Charlotte,en,2591

"Carmel Restaurant offers a pleasant ambiance and excellent customer service, but falls short in value and freshness. While the atmosphere was inviting, the menu proved to be overpriced, and the food lacked the freshness one would expect. Despite Buckhead Shops' reputation for great dining options, and dining at Carmel in New York, this particular location left me hesitant to return. Our waitress was friendly, but lacked knowledge about the dishes and offered minimal recommendations on drinks or desserts. Overall, while the experience had its highlights, it ultimately fell short of expectations",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcExlT0l3EAE,Atlanta,en,416
"Not the welcoming experience but most in the area aren‚Äôt looking for that. Yea, I‚Äôm new to Georgia but this isn‚Äôt hibachi, more like thrown together. My hibachi had way too much juice or sauce in the food. It is well seasoned I can‚Äôt complain but there‚Äôs much needed to be learned before naming a dish. I‚Äôm assuming this is what Campbellton Rd calls hibachi. I didn‚Äôt have the traditional vegetables sold with hibachi, I even feel scammed because $40 was way too much for this and a powder lemonade. I wont be going back tho honestly.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwX3FteVpREAE,Atlanta,en,856

"If you want over priced food go here. If you want overpriced drinks go here! After a night at the club we decided to keep the moment going. From the outside this place looks amazing however looks can be deceiving.  It‚Äôs 3:30 am on a Thursday night when I heard the lady said its $80 for entry (I actually chuckled and said to myself this is not Vegas ) however I was with a group who already had a section so I wasn‚Äôt worried about a price . The lady then claims that the  group inside already has the maximum amount of people in the section ( 4 ) and it will be extra for any additional people cool,  it was handled by the men we were with. Upon entry I was hit with a very foul smell, it literally smelled like sewage however once we went up into like this jungle blue area the smell was no more. Once we got to the section the drinks came and they were poured into Flask (I guess to prevent people from throwing the bottles idk why ) but heres the biggest red flag!  I could taste the alcohol and tell that this was not the brand actual liquor it‚Äôs fake version. I was actually shocked that such an established would try to deceive people . I guess they expect people to be too high to even notice lol but I was pissed although I wasn‚Äôt even the one paying. For  10 wings it cost $36 dollars the most I‚Äôve seen for wings since I‚Äôve to ATL . I do think this place needs be properly inspected though I saw some safety concerns such as the fabric on the roof,  in case of fire there was no sprinklers or perhaps the sprinklers are blocked by the fabric, also no proper ventilation and not a second exit.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREckpiN3FRRRAB,Atlanta,en,139

"A first timer since recent move to GA. This restaurant was highly recommended for soul food. I tried two different meals and while the food was to my liking the drive-thru conversation between the coworkers were awful. I am certain they did not know their microphone was hot so next time situational awareness. While I with my child was waiting in line the employees were heard talking about various vermin, their relationships, and using profanity. The way the drive thru is set up I could not just drive away because it‚Äôs closed in as you wait in lone with poles. I am could only imagine how the atmosphere is inside the establishment. As it took around 10 minutes just to order once I did the communication to me by the employee was not very welcoming when so was trying to understand the menu.

"On my 3rd visit to Mulantes I switched up my usual fried shrimp and fish order to a cheeseburger and fries! Hoping to experience more wonderful food from this restaurant I patiently awaited my order . I asked the waitress to ensure my burger was well done with no pink . After receiving the order I first noticed how small the burger was for $19.00 . I was the size of a small kids burger but more than that the burger appeared to be gray which caused me to break a piece of the  meat off and smell it! The meat had a spoiled small as if it was expired meat or left out for a long period of time . I asked my friends to also confirm the stink that the meat had and all 3 of us agreed that something wasn‚Äôt right with the meat. I asked the waitress to send it back and to take it off of my bill . Because I
Has hungry I asked to keep the fries . The manager never came to our table to apologize and told my waitress that nothing was wrong with meat ! Smh yes it was! I was charged $6.00 for a hand full of fries ! The manager walked right by our table and never apologised or said anything to me . I will never eat there again and started to scream out to the other guest Not to eat the Meat . I was told they will
Serve dog meat to their customers! They don‚Äôt care they just want the money . I am thinking about calling the health department on them and especially the female manager that felt that I wasn‚Äôt owed apology!

"I hadn‚Äôt been here in years since they changed ownership. Looking at some of the reviews I was leery. Boy am I glad that I didn‚Äôt listen. Went here for dinner last night and everything was absolutely delicious. The fried chicken, fried catfish, lambs, crab cakes and sides of Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collards, potato salad, and corn bread were all superb. It definitely tasted like eating at your grandmothers. The potato salad was just like my Gma‚Äôs; finely diced with celery, celery seed, and a slight tang of mustard accompanied by a slight sweetness.  The collards are vegan hence no meat but were still delicious, tender, and flavorful. The drinks were delicious as well. The portion sizes were quite large with everyone having leftovers except for the lamb chops they were so delicious that my friend ate all of them. Matter of fact when she accidentally attempted to cut them with the wrong side of the knife it still went through.

We were told by our server that it was the kitchen‚Äôs fault. But it went downhill from there. After several attempts we finally spoke to a manager. She said she would rush our food, and shortly after, sure enough our entrees appeared. They were lukewarm so they had likely been sitting a while, but the food nonetheless were good. Then our appetizers showed up (we never did get our salads or dessert) and so we began asking for adjustments to our bill. In the end, after arguing and a very confusing comp/cashier experience, we were told we had to pay for our entrees because we ate the food.

"This review is for Pasta City
3322 Georgia Ave NW, Washington DC. I do not know why the address is coming up as Mister Rotisserie.  Let me start by saying this is my first and last time I will  ever order from this place. I ordered Alfredo Ultimate Pasta and Marinara Beef Pasta. They put spaghetti noodles with the Alfredo Ultimate Pasta when in fact it suppose to be with Fettuccine Noodles. The Alfredo Ultimate Pasta suppose to come with shrimp, chicken and steak.  OMG, they only sprinkled steak crumbs, 3 shrimps and nice amount of chicken, SMH. The Marinara Beef Pasta suppose to come with spaghetti sauce, instead it came with some kind of white sauce, this is crazy, I never seen anything like this before. I thought it was only one of my order was wrong but both were wrong. How do they stay in business with all the negative reviews, I just had to look this up?

We didn't have a reservation so we had to wait for a bit, but despite being seated at a table away from the main area, the service was still very attentive and the food didn't take too long to come out.
We got the pork soup dumplings, crab meat tofu stew, Yangzhou meatball, and nine-spice rabbit. Their soup dumplings are my favorite in Flushing now that the quality at other well-known restaurants has declined, with fairly thin skin and lots of soup. The other dish that surprised us in a good way was the rabbit, the flavor was subtle but very aromatic.

We had wanted to try out their beggar's chicken but they told us they only make about a dozen a day and were sold out, so that's a perfect excuse for us to return soon!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENHUtbmFnEAE,New York,en,4345

"I visited Cafe Flora based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation, and it surpassed expectations. I love trying quirky/creative vegetarian and vegan restaurants, and this one definitely fit the bill!

We called ahead (30 min) since we were a larger party of 8, and they had the table ready when we got there, even though they don‚Äôt take reservations. The table location wasn‚Äôt ideal since it was by the door to their outdoor seating area and there was a frequent cold breeze, but thoughtful nonetheless. Our waiter was super friendly, which made our experience even more memorable.

We ordered nearly the entire menu and shared everything family style. My favorites were the brussel sprouts, coconut tofu lettuce wraps, eggplant & bell pepper campanelle, and turkish cauliflower polenta. The flavor profile for each of these was pretty complex and balanced.

A few of us got drinks - the mulled wine, wakey wakey, and rosemary lemon drop - which were all pretty delicious and strong. We ended the night with dessert, which were yummy but not neccesarily something to write home about.

Overall, it was a memorable experience and I‚Äôd definitely return if I‚Äôm in the area again! Easily on my top 10 restaurant list.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCbllETmJnEAE,Seattle,en,4851

"So I order using the online menu, and I‚Äôm appalled that when I picked up my order, it was $10 more than the online menu indicated.  I order 1 dinner (fried rice/2 appetizers) and small side order of Peking Ravioli (total of 4).  Cost of $24.40.  I could have splurged on Chipotle for far less and much better food.  I mentioned to the female cashier about the discrepancies of the online menu and she immediately became defensive, explaining that the online menu had been updated.  I responded that obviously some advertisers did not get the memo. She persisted to the point where I said, look, it is what it is. You haven‚Äôt informed your public and that‚Äôs on you. She blamed her boss and said she‚Äôd inform him.  I doubt I‚Äôm the only person who‚Äôd experienced surprise, and the first time she said she‚Äôd tell her boss.  I‚Äôd guess the next time she tells her boss WILL BE THE FIRST TIME though.

The food?  I‚Äô‚Äôm from Roslindale and patronized this same business since 1980 or so when it opened. Original manager was fabulous. You went in, he knew what you wanted, we talked baseball the whole time, he was a huge fan. The neighborhood owned him. He was one of us. Always the tastiest food.  Today I ordered Kung Pao extra spicy, Egg Roll, and Peking Ravioli side.  Fried rice was part of the dinner component.  I‚Äôve never tasted Kung Pao Chicken so tasteless.  Spicy?  Milk has more zest to it than this slop. And it didn‚Äôt look like a good quality dish, chicken, vegetable, etc. no peanuts which always is part of the dish. Sub par as to appetizing view. Terrible food. Egg Roll was ok. Peking‚Äôs, nothing to stop in or go out of your way for.

Being a customer of this place for over 40 years?  No more.  Done.  There are plenty of Chinese food restaurants right there in Rossie Square.  I‚Äôll give them a try.  I hope this review provides you with some forwarded insight.

"Tell me where you can go to get outstanding BBQ, buy allocated bourbon by the bottle, watch games, smoke cigars on the patio on Saturday nights, and join their Wednesday whisky club? Our first visit to Cinder was a great experience. The owner and staff were welcoming. The Old Fashioned is reasonably priced and they use Sazerac. If you want a bottle of some great bourbons, look no further. As long as you buy some food, you're good to go. If you like pork rinds. Then you can't miss these... If you don't like them, then you have to order them just to listen to them keep popping at the table for 5 minutes after they are served. Sunday means brisket day. Chopped, sliced, platter or sandwich, or even by the pound. Pulled pork was outstanding. The 12 yr old loved the Mac n Cheese, we loved the collards, and the sauces were great depending on your taste. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample of all of them. Also, on Wed nights, they have a whiskey club night that is something you need to actually be a member of.

"Service was over and beyond my expectations, the price was worth the quality of my meal, I was asked if everything was made to my satisfaction.
I felt everything was designed to meet desired food and dinning experience . This location surpassed the typical restaurant standard of service a customer would experience since the decline of the restaurant  industry as a whole post-covid, some of the staff members such as Jayden and Stephanie checked on me multiple times to ensure my order was correct and if there was anymore they could provide. This was my first visit to a smashburger and introduction to its menu or top notch service. I would recommend this location not only for its service and quality of food, but, most importantly, the cleanliness. Keep up the hard work. I will make sure to stop in anytime I'm in the area. This location will make it harder to want to waste my money on the contaminated slop the competition has to offer. The quality of food and service is a reflection of the pride the staff has for there establishment, which sadly is becomming a thing of the the past.

"Hands down one of the best seafood spots in Charlotte! The quality of food here is way better than one of those Asian restaurants. Crablegs are bigger, signature butter sauce taste like it‚Äôs made with crack‚Ä¶. Haven‚Äôt had a rich butter sauce with seafood since seafood connection closed. Pricing is on point with the market and isn‚Äôt any cheaper or more expensive than other seafood restaurants. However, they do offer daily/ weekly specials which can be attractive if you are on a budget. I can see parking being an issue, but I can say I‚Äôve never experienced it- always in and out! I don‚Äôt care for showing my ID for my order, cashier really attempted to not give me my already paid for food without it, but the cook OK‚Äôd it as I am a regular weekly customer. The signage is clearly posted in the establishment, so they technically have legs to stand on with that rule, so just remember to have it if you order online. Overall, it‚Äôs a great establishment and I will continue to patronize.

Edit: I came back to say, although the food is good- the establishment obstacles to obtain the food is similar to the Olympics (just joking), but ordering can be challenging. So I already mentioned the ID requirement to pick up food you paid for already. Specials are advertised in the store, but you can only pay cash for it. So if you stop by and decide you want a special item along with something else, they make you produce 2 different forms of payment- card payment for menu items, then cash for the special items. No cash- you will denied the special or told to go get cash. There‚Äôs no phone orders availability, so if you want them while your on the road, be prepared to pull over, check to see if you have valid ID on you, then place the order online if the site is working (it froze on me twice trying to enter my payment method). Makes me kinda miss establishments that wants to service the community and made it easy to patron.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSeXFlM2R3EAE,Charlotte,en,2689

I‚Äôm not sure if the host and server were judging us based on our age but the service was already lacking. Lily was our server and only took our orders and never came back. She checked on other tables but never came back to ours. There was a 20% auto gratuity but it seems unfair for us to be charged that when our server never came up to us but to take our order and payment.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREOGRpWnF3RRAB,New Orleans,en,6149

"I went this past weekend to celebrate our friends birthday and every single one of us loved the restaurant. Our friend is a vegan and she had so many choices to chose from. We ordered so much food and drinks and the bill was so cheap compared to the number I had in my head lol we got red meat, seafood, chicken, veggies, soups, tofu all of it delicious. I loved the curry cutlet dish! Staff was very kind and always cleaning up the table, talking to us very present and kind. Very clean and great for photos. Will be going back for sure!

My family and I made a reservation for 6 people. One of our guest couldn't make it. When they sat us down the waitress said where is your 6th person. I told her they can no longer make it. She went and got the host to make us move to a smaller table because we were no longer 6 guests we were only 5 guests. Minutes later they sat a family of 5 in that same spot they made us move. I was furious! I felt discriminated and shamed. The food was also very expensive and it really wasn't that good. I'll never be back there again.

Dim sum was standard, fairly greasy and loaded with sodium and MSG. Our group was thirsty for the rest of the day! Better to just drive towards Quincy for the options there.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEZzZXSnlBRRAB,Boston,en,1581

Start out with the amazing food, drinks (the Rum punch got me every time, so yummy!), and service in the restaurant area. Once you wrap it up, they have a lounge upstairs called the Hummingbird on the weekend! Dope drinks and rooftop vibes... Talk about the perfect spot for an all evening into night date night spot or a time on the town with your girls!

They have a more family-friendly location - Algiers Point - much more spacious, but offers the same great quality of good, drinks, and vibes! There isn't a lounge at this location, but it doesn't take anything away from it.

Whichever your mood, check out either of the locations!

The chicken was extremely dry, there was A LOT of it though so there's that? Might have been what made it hard to swallow but the Taziki was also super dry, paste like, and there were no tomatoes and light lettuce.  Plus for $12 bucks it was kinda small, like 6"" long, maybe if it came with a pop it would have been more satisfying but I was on the run and figured it had tomatoes and Taziki, but it was SO dry I couldn't eat it while walking! I had to wait till later and later wasn't much better.

"February 2024:
Enjoyed a family dinner on a Thursday night. We pre-ordered the chicken stuffed with sticky rice. This dish is quite enjoyable because it's fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice that has a lot of delicious ingredients mixed in. This place did a good job.

Peking Duck was excellent. The skin was very crispy . Fish fillet with asparagus was a Big hit too. Simple and cooked perfectly.

The white chicken with ginger sauce was another good dish.

Everything was tasty . We ordered the pork belly taro clay pot dish that is an old time favorite and hard to find nowadays. Everyone enjoyed that too.

"I enjoyed dinner with my boyfriend at this clean and authentic establishment. However, the food itself was subpar, I fine dine frequently, most recently going to Malio‚Äôs in Tampa Florida. The escargot there was lovely as well as the one here  at la Grotta. But the burrata cheese lacked flavor, and the bread was rustic but yet again lacked flavor. The olive oil was served without any herbs or seasoning, which is fine, but it didn‚Äôt taste like a cold pressed olive oil so I was confused on why it was served so basic. Their wine list is insanely huge, and you would assume that you could find something for everyone. Unfortunately for me I like champagne, and they only have 2-3 champagne‚Äôs they sell by the glass and they are all bitter. So I had to settle with a moscato that wasn‚Äôt that good. My partner doesn‚Äôt too much care for wines, he‚Äôs more of a whiskey drinker. Although the establishment was beautiful, and the food was authentic I‚Äôm very disappointed in the initial experience me and my boyfriend had to face. Given the amount of time this establishment has been around I expected to be experiencing something better than Flemings but the food didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations. My waiter was absolutely amazing and gave great suggestions for our meals and desserts. He was attentive, funny , and accommodating to all of our requests.

"This place is definitely one of my favorites in NYCü•∞ü•∞ü§©... even when I visit other places in the city, I tend to finish my nights at this restaurant because of their music and their pretty affordable appetizers and drinks (which are good-good).

It's really weird to me to find mixed reviews over here, considering my friends, clients and myself never had an issue with them. I'd suggest you try these type of places by yourself, because you never know the two sides of a story.

Aroma has always delivered the best service no matter the crowd, the day nor the time. And I'm a regular there, so I know what I'm talking about.ü§ó

Overall, it is a safe and clean restaurant with great vibes and ambiance, their music selection is always fiiiirrreeee  THE FOOD: absolutely delicious, and if your a wine lover , they have a wide variety of world renowned brands and amazingly good cocktails. Try the margaritas and the Passion Fruit juice, sooo good... Specially the tamarindo mojito and the Jumbo Rainbow margarita, one of those and you'll be set!

If you're into pasta, order their Penne a la Vodka, the lobster ravioli or their Seafood Fra Diavolo ü•∞. From the appetizers menu, I recommend the fried shumai, mofongo trios, the quesadilla, the Spring rolls, and finally the cheese and spinach empanadas.

Also, make sure to order sushi, IT'S THE BEST in the area! and actually one of the best in the city, for an unbeatable price. My favorite sushi rolls are ""Nemo Roll"" and ""Aroma Roll"" (those are a little spicy).

OH! and make yourself a favor and try their Brunch, no worries with the kids, because they have a welcoming environment for everyone.  #recommended",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLOWNudVh3EAE,New York,en,4078
"Wow, My first and last time I ever dine here. When I first arrived it about 2-3 minutes to be greated , then I was passed off to another hostess. I was asked did I perfer inside or outside , I said outside. We were walked threw the kitchen area/oyster grill I guess to the patio. I wanted to face the water so i sat in that direction. The hostess started to move tables around and ran into me coming and going with a table when she was told that she couldnt seat that many tables together. The oysters came out ok at best, before we could finish the oysters the entree was being placed ontop of the table. The pasta was over cooked and the shrimp were from a plastic shrimp mold at your local grocery store. The beer wasnt too bad just warmed up by the time it got to the table. To note it wasnt busy at all on the second floor, I would estimate half the tables were filled.I didnt have the energy to complain,in my opinion just go to Dragos.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEM01teFRBEAE,New Orleans,en,6553

"NOT RECOMMENDED. Recently moved to the area from NJ and wanted to support businesses in the area. Most Chinese food places in NJ/NY make flavorful and fresh food; not this place.

Food: The food isn‚Äôt fresh, no flavor. The fried rice was pulled from a rice pot, oily with no vegetables and heavy on the soy sauce. My entire meal was mostly rice with a few strips of spareribs. The crab ragoons were refried so the top was crispy but the bottom was soggy.

Service: Felt rushed, and oddly uncomfortable. They treated me as if I was going to steal something constantly asking me if I was ready to order. Again, first time here so I was reading the menu.

"Griff's , the King of fast food burgers in Fort Worth , Texas. I visited today and ordered the triple giant monster meal. The burger was cooked on a griddle with the crunchies on the patties like a smashed burger. Think old school burger. Dressed the way I wanted it with a fresh bun. Very large diet coke and large fries came with the meal. Thin fries tasted a little off. That burger blew any burger from whataburger into oblivion ! Pure awesomeness. $12. and change. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The burgers are cooked to order with my meal taking no longer than 5 minute to arrive for dine -in. Griff's is FIRE !!!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqc3UzTTR3RRAB,Dallas,en,3771

I know it was the end of the day but come on. I was really disappointed this is the saddest Dominican fried chicken plate I've seen . When he said 6 pieces of chicken I wasn't expecting lollipop chicken wings. I paid 8.99 for a side of beans and basically got sauce and a handful of beans. If there wasn't enough food they could've just said that so I would have wasted my time and money.

"The service here is top notch. My wife and I sat at the bar. We weren't that hungry so the portions here were perfect and I was way more interested in the bar. We sat at the bar and our servers were very gracious. They created a mezcal flight for me based on my little knowledge of mezcal, my alcoholic preferences, and what dishes we ordered. $48 for a mezcal flight, 3 servings from 3 different bottles. Each one was very different from the last. My wife had a non alcoholic drink, La Orgua. I took a sip. It was a very mild flavored drink. Looked beautiful but tasted watered down. We ordered the guacamole which came from cotija cheese on top. The guac serving was generous and delicious. The aguachiles were Oaxacan style. I've had aguachiles in Mexico City so I was foolishly expecting a different flavor so I did not enjoy that much. Nothing wrong with the dish but I felt the seasoning was lacking. Still a generous portion. Both dishes served with tostadas. I'll definitely be back for mezcal and to try cocktails.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqeHJfZ2h3RRAB,New York,en,4451

"This was my first time and my last time dining here. Though to say that I ""dined"" is a gross understatement. Last night, I came here with my friends who had good things to say about this restaurant. We were greeted by the owner, who bragged about servicing Stevie Wonder, the Georgia Congressional Representatives, and all the positive reviews that her establishment has received. She even went so far as to say that her Egg Fu Young was highly rated by her New York customers. As a native New Yorker I was curious about the food. We were seated and placed our orders. Well, my dish was garnished with a hair smack dab in the middle of the plate. When I brought this to our server's attention, she was very apathetic and merely took the dish back. Her response made me scared to try anything else. So while my friends apparently had no issues with their food, I just sipped on the Coke that I ordered.

When it came time to pay the bill, she handed me mine with an attitude and let me know that she removed the dish from the bill, like she was doing me a big favor. Yet, she had no problem charging me $4.36 for a so, so glass of Coke. As we were leaving, the owner stopped us and asked if everything was okay, to which I responded no. She made no effort to find out why I was unhappy with my experience. She turned her attention back to the other party that entered the restaurant and proceeded to regale them with her stories. My friend, who witnessed the exchange, was appalled by her response. Rather than cause a scene, I decided to leave. I was already disgusted by the careless lack of cleanliness. I was even more turned off by how I was treated by the staff and the owner. While I understand that things happen, how you handle the situation speaks volumes. I got the message about this place loud and clear about the value they place on offering a clean and quality dining experience. Though it has received a lot of reviews for the food, I can't confirm or deny the quality of the food, but I can tell you that the service is of very poor quality. Something to think about if you're considering dining here.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaHVYNWRBEAE,Atlanta,en,631

"I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. I mean WOW! The guy at the window taking orders on the phone saw us come in and couldn't even give us the courtesy of acknowledgement. Then he let's us stand there for a few minutes completely ignored (super awkward). I finally asked if we could have a table for two. I mentioned we were there for a couple of slices to which he replied (cutting me off) ""Only whole pies if dining in."" The way he said it though...there was a guy tossing pizza dough standing behind him who just creepily stared at us. They both looked at us like we were some type of stain they both didn't want to bother with. I wouldn't ve had a problem ordering a whole pizza and taking the rest home had he said it in a nicer manner. We thanked him and left in awe.

Don't worry, you won't be able to hear your friends anyway, unless you're shouting across their drink into their faces. The servers are truly sweet but the volume is unbearable. They charge the same for well as top shelf, at least they did for us, so get the good stuff!

Not everywhere is good for everyone..the tea is the worst I've ever had..I took two drinks and literally sent it back and got water. It's weird how certain owners think they can add crazy combinations of food and think it's good. I had a mozzarella burger with tomato jam etc. First it was so messy to eat second the slab of fried mozzarella was sweet and just not complimenting the hamburger and the tomato jam was different but not good. I took everything off and just ate the meat.. no stars from me,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5ei0tSlJnEAE,Charlotte,en,2735

"I‚Äôll preface this by saying I was a server and bartender all through college in several restaurants -

My girlfriend and I sat in the dining room, server walked over, dropped 1 menu and didn‚Äôt say anything. I informed him there would be 3 of us and he just left the single menu to return later with still no menus or introduction or words at all‚Ä¶  just sort of stood there as if to say ‚Äúok I‚Äôm listening‚Äù but never really spoke.

We moved to the bar side and received slightly better service but still no introduction, very few words, I had to assert myself to order anything before the server walked away. I imagine they‚Äôre probably missing out on plenty of revenue from no upselling and hardly any communication at all

Food was ok, service extremely slow, was not very busy either. It‚Äôs a shame this place is suffering from such weak leadership, we were excited to try it.

Please try the melted Brie appetizer and any panini they‚Äôre all amazing.

"It was not busy at all. 1900 was the time on 3/22.  I sat in the corner since the high areas were taken. About half way through a lady tending to the bar patrons says ""ma'am,  I hope your not too comfortable,  that is for handicap people."" 2 other patrons say...""there are no handicap people, but we're sure you'd get up."" I look around and the place is empty. Not a sign in the entire place for handicap people.  I get up,  pick up my meal and sit somewhere else. Here is the picture of the handicap area. I honestly feel like the lady was unprofessional and targeting me.   She created an unpleasant environment. The food was not good and when this happened, I wanted to regurgitate everything.  20$ for 1 scoop of rice and all sides are in plastic minicups prepackaged the size of a spoon.

Yes, it‚Äôs an airport bar but a little bit of decency and respect towards your customers would be nice after paying $35 dollars for a beer and a salad.

"****HAIR IN FOOD*******

Came to eat here After sending some stuff in the mail for my job
Was super hungry I ordered the crispy tuna of the small plates figuring it would come out first and the spicy garden bowl

I was excited when the crispy tuna came out only to be crust with disappointment and discussed to find a hair in my food.

Let my server know I sat next to the bar she was bartending all was well. She was a good waitress. Until I saw my bill after I paid and she charged me for the spicy tuna, she got me a new one, but I had to wait until my bowl came out to eat. I worked in the restaurant industry for several years and I would not let a Guest pay for something that they had to wait extra long for because they found a hair in their food‚Ä¶",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbk9mUUFnEAE,Charlotte,en,2365

He then tried to sell me a pie and told me it might cheer me up. LOL.
Guess what‚Ä¶.YOU STILL GOT MY ORDER WRONG.   YOU GET MY ORDER WRONG EVERY SINGLE TIME I‚ÄôM UP THERE.  It‚Äôs because the people working the drive thru DO NOT LISTEN.

The tapas are generously portioned (for tapas). The green beans were great. The chef made them saut√©ed vs fried for me and I would suggest they make them a permanent addition to menu.

The lamb chops are why I would come back again and again. $15 for two $7 for each additional chop.

I also really enjoyed the most traditional tapas - the shrimp. This was the one that actually made me feel like this was a true Spanish spot.

"I have gone to Planta several times, but today was an utter mess. I have had so many different servers, and they all have been amazing!!! I had a female today that not once checked on us. I wish I knew her name but she never introduced herself. She would actually come to the table next to us and those people got excellent service. From the time we sat down, she had an issue. The service was so bad that I am not sure I will ever go back. I ordered to Chicken and waffles without knowing that there are jalape√±os on it. I can eat them but with the spicy syrup and peppers, it was overwhelmingly spicy. I am just getting over an abdominal infection so the spicy flavors were just too much. I explained it to the server we had and I promise you the entire staff was involved in the request to get it switched; the whispering; the stares; the passive/aggressive behaviors were so unprofessional and petty!!!  We sat on the patio and were able to watch the entire show that was going on all initiated by our server. The manager came out and while she was friendly, it was obvious the server had spread negativity to her as well. The manager resolved the issue with reflections. Everyone that came after us was gone even before  my issue started. Did I tip her? Yes, I did. Did I want to? No, I didn‚Äôt. I taught college, but I felt like I was pushed back into high school.

"My husband and I came to North Carolina from Pennsylvania for a friend's wedding. Our hotel was near and my husband decided to surprise me with lunch. I had no idea where we were going, we just knew we were starving. To my absolute delight he brings me here to La Cocina!!! This establishment has such a cozy, relaxed atmosphere and I loved that they were playing good old fashioned Spanish music that I was super familiar with and was able to sing along with and dance in my seat to, as I enjoyed my meal. There was a very small ""lunch crowd"" I guess you could call it but, not rowdy or anything of the sort thankfully. Now to the SERVICE! Our server was Alex (Alejandro actually but I guess he uses Alex for the job). This gentleman is an absolute GEM!!! From the moment he introduced himself and took our drink orders, his demeanor was wonderful. He gave awesome, detailed recommendations about the variety of sangria's and drinks that they served. I went with his recommendations! lol When he brought us our drinks, he asked if we were ready to order and I proceeded to ask him about the menu since it was my first time ever visiting. He was so detailed and took his time explaining as well as recommending a variety of items to try. My husband ordered the Tender Ribeye and I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas. They served you tortilla chips and homemade salsa as you wait for your food. Without a doubt, their house salsa is one of, if not THE best salsa both my husband and I have ever had! We told Alex how much we enjoyed it and I didn't realize it at the time but, he took note of it! (keep this in mind for later). Now, my mother back in Pa has been looking for a place that makes authentic tamales and unfortunately, we can't find anywhere back home in PA. As luck would have it, what happened to be on the menu???? You guessed it...TAMALES! lol So I told Alex about my mom's predicament with her sooooo desired tamales and told him that I would like to try one to see if I liked it, so as to bring some back to my mom. He jotted down an order for 1 along with the rest of our food and went away to the kitchen. When he comes back, this wonderful gentleman came back with not 1 but 2 tamales, each made differently, so that I may try them and decide which one to take back home. He was super attentive, truly cared about whether or not we were enjoying the food and that we had everything that we needed as well as talking with us as if we were old friends catching up after a long time. All that along with never missing a beat with his other tables! Needless to say my husband and I enjoyed our experience here in every aspect. I ended up ordering a dozen tamales to take back home lol. I thanked Alex for absolutely everything and especially for making my first ever Mexican restaurant experience in North Carolina such a wonderful one. OH, and we also took a huge container of that delicious salsa of theirs back home too! LOL! If you want a great dining experience that will make your taste buds dance, and an even more awesome dining experience because of such amazing quality servers, then definitely come here to La Cocina! My husband and I cannot wait to come back on vacation next year and eat here again!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMXRYeGRnEAE,Cary,en,2203
Only been here twice and both times I was rudely serviced. Today I go in and I o originally wanted a spicy chicken sandwich but the lady told me that they didn't have any more sandwiches so I asked what they had she said just chicken and tenders so I place my order for a three-piece tender meal after I've already paid for my order another customer walks in wanting a chicken sandwich and for some reason she decided to sell the other woman a chicken sandwich instead of me when she literally just told me out of her mouth that they don't have any sandwiches and had me pay for something that had been sitting out because they didn't want to make anything fresh. I don't understand why this place is still even open with all the rude service lack of communication and just a waste of my time and money.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5cDVpaWZBEAE,Atlanta,en,965

"We initially booked reservations and were confirmed for it. However, when we went, they seated us at the patio saying that we had outdoor dining confirmation and it was freezing cold.  There was no mention of outdoor dining in the confirmation.  They had a fireplace, but it didn't provide heat at all even though we were seated right next to it. They should at least have a couple of heaters outside if they put people outside for dining.  That's what other restaurants do.  They provided blankets, but it wasn't enough as it was super cold. They later seated us by the bar when some of the guests were gone. The service wasn't great as well as they messed up our order, and the little lamps provided outside weren't working.  We had to tell the server a couple of times about it. When we were seated back indoors, the server didn't help us out with carrying our water or food.  However, the guy at the bar was really nice and got our orders right.  He also made sure we were given all of our orders, and he checked on our orders.  All the pointers to him for giving us a good service than our previous server.  The food was okay too.  The sausage, salad, and sauted vegetables were the only good things at the place.  Everything else was okay.  I would definitely suggest checking out the food options beforehand as there are very few options for non-meat eaters.  I would also recommend knowing what kind of reservations you have to have a better dining experience.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkbkxmUElnEAE,Washington,en,4973

First I want to commend the front of house staff and everyone that had a hand in the brunch event today it was great food and wonderful people. The reason for the one star review is the owner or manager Brian. What an absolute horrible experience. From cutting off your own staff while we are in the middle of being seated. Talking down to them. Not listening to a word we said about being for the event. Sitting us in the wrong section and not letting anyone know we were there at all. When we finally got up and asked about maybe getting some water after 20 minutes he informed us that there was a process to the event and we needed to be patient. Meanwhile in the room the event was going on they were already on their second drinks and appetizers. The entire time he spoke down to us like we were an inconvenience to be at his restaurant. Watching him interact with other guest and his staff I couldn‚Äôt believe how he was. Simply put everything and everyone except this person was outstanding and we would love to come back once he‚Äôs no longer there. Hope others see the great staff and food and don‚Äôt take it out on them. Brian is the issue.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURELTZXcG1RRRAB,Cary,en,1939

There‚Äôs nothing fancy about it. But, honestly, that‚Äôs what made it so good. The meat was seasoned well, and the condiments were the right amount. Only complaint was the fries were not crispy by the time we got home so next time we will ask them to poke a hole in the container to let out the steam.

My favorite delivery man came and when I started to prepare my plate the egg was super soft and soggy. Called n spoke to the manager and they sent me another order but the second order was even worse and it had a weird taste and thin hard black pieces like burnt bones.
