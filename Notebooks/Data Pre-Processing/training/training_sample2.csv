"This is an Asian-owned restaurant/ neighborhood bar. I traveled to support this establishment thinking it was Black-owned since Suite says it's been around 50 years. I'm not not sure how ownership changed or any of the history other than what's on the the website, but the food had to have been better in the past for it to be around.

Ordered the fried chicken, fish, greens and mac and cheese. The food was below average and disappointing.

An owner who actually grew up eating southern soul food would have better standards.

Alcohol selection was limited.

The staff was nice.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREbzRlWFh3EAE,Washington,en,5159

No where to sit. Food is average. And they expect you to eat a tender meal dry. If not you have to pay for sause that should be free. So just find a different location cause this one sucks,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5aWRyR0N3EAE,Dallas,en,3643

"I just received the most bland, tasteless chicken that I have ever eaten from here before. It was so unseasoned, it didn't even have a smell. The biscuits have been changed, were dry, they had no honey butter on them. This Krispy Krunchy Chicken used to have the tastiest fast food chicken on the market, it was my go-to, but it clearly has some serious quality issues lately or maybe new ownership has all their attention placed on their burger business at the same address instead. So disappointed, what a waste of money and calories! I won't be ordering from this location again!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0NE15alBREAE,Washington,en,4923

"Update:
I‚Äôd say quality has gone down in the last two years they roll their injera and don‚Äôt put the platter for on the injera they place everything separate its like they‚Äôve changed for the white population, injera is not the same and shiro quality has went down their portions are small as well. I really like this place as they offer alcohol and live music but I can say it‚Äôs no longer worth the hype. You can see the reviewed pictures of how the platters are placed on different plates when that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs supposed to be served at all

They‚Äôre priced a bit high for a new place, however their food is good, portions are a hit or miss. Sometimes they give you a decent portion other times they hide everything with injera and barely put any sauce in so I suggest checking before you leave. Their injera is good but their teff injera is okay. The restaurants atmosphere seems like they want to make it welcoming to Americans, which is good in Seattle. But their food also does not always seem authentic because of that, like they purposely make it less spicy. But they offer deli every and takeout later than any Ethiopian restaurant in Seattle so just by that they‚Äôre up points. Always friendly though and one of the few Ethiopian sports bars in Seattle that make it seem like they want everyone there (not my atmosphere I prefer Ethiopian/ Eritrean only) but hey in Seattle if you want your business to survive you adapt and I can respect that. I believe their chef is East African although I could not tell, she looked a bit Hispanic but she makes good food I was definitely a bit hesitant when I first went. They‚Äôre not my first choice but if Chefs Cafe or Kezira are closed then I will go here so definitely top 3 for Ethiopian restaurants although unlike Chefs and Kezira they do not offer Ayeb with your platter, not sure if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a veggie platter or what but their ayeb ‚Äúhouse cheese‚Äù is priced pretty high at $3 but they do give you a good amount. If you‚Äôre an American wanting to try a new place that feels welcoming however still cultural, this is your place but if you‚Äôre habesha I suggest ordering to go.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NjdlNWJ3EAE,Seattle,en,4887
"We had reservations for four at 8pm. Place was packed. Our table wasn't ready for about 30 minutes but we were eventually seated. We ordered drinks and the $6 bread service immediately. We all did either the three-course or four-course dinners which were easy and priced well. I added an A' La Carte Mixed Lettuce & Arugula ""Wedge"" salad which wasn't the best. The lettuce was a bit warm and wilted like they had it under a heat lamp. My daughter had the Little Gem Caesar Salad which was extremely too fishy from the anchovies. They took it back. We did the Creamy Shrimp Bisque, Escargots En Croute (very good), Pelican Club Baked Oysters, two of the Braised Pork Shanks, Louisiana Cioppino - In Its Own Pot, two of the Decadent Chocolate Cakes, and the White Chocolate Bread Pudding.
Everything was decent but they were too busy and our only server just couldn't keep up. They really need some support servers for drinks, bread, and table clearing. It is the main reason for 3-Stars instead of 5! There are too many places in NOLA to eat, so we probably won't be back!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbExudGd3RRAB,New Orleans,en,5644

"Came here around 8pm with my family of 7.  The food was fantastic and the staff was incredibly friendly.   Honestly the staff was effing awesome.   It was an hour before closing and they weren't treating us any differently, when we picked out bottles of water/drinks by the register the guy checking us out went out of his way to make sure we had the refrigerated beverages instead.  They took the extra time and care to make sure the food we ordered was fresh and not whatever was left out during the day.   I wish we had one of these places back home in Boston.   Allthough think of it as a chipolte but with a Mediterranean/middle eastern twist. The Google photos are misleading.  However I hope the owners of the store reads this because the people working here deserve a raise, I don't remember seeing a tipping option, if there was I would of tipped heavily. 100% recommend.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGeWZUVW5BRRAB,Washington,en,5091

I honestly enjoy food all the time but I‚Äôm disappointed one time I had an unpleasant experience with an older guy that worked there. I couldn‚Äôt find something I thought I left and he was pretty rude and making unnecessary comments.

Went for a friend's birthday party. Had to wait almost an hour for them to open. Because the kitchen staff wasn't there yet. Ordered a round of drinks they came in glasses.

"Recently, I ordered delivery food from Chinese Dragon. I had zero expectations (either way) for their food; it was late, but their kitchen was open and they were willing to deliver to my slightly out-of-range location for a small, additional delivery fee. (A paltry $ amount, compared to the ridiculous/endless delivery and service fees Uber Cheats, Grub Nub, etc. tack on to every order.)

45 minutes later, my food arrived -- and it was wonderful! Creamy egg drop soup; perfect saucy chicken saut√©ed to perfection with a colorful mix of tasty chinese vegetables; delicious chicken fried rice (replete with real, large chunks of meat throughout); admidst this abundance though the rich, tender beef teriaki skewers were actually the first thing to be devoured. (I would usually save one for later but hey...life is short and their siren song called me.) So good!

In summary, I still can't believe that I polished off so much food, so easily at 1am...or that there were so many (non-teriaki) leftovers the next day. A++ service and food, I highly recommend Chinese Dragon!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkeHBPZE53EAE,Boston,en,1619

Our waiter came to our table with a runny nose, like fully running from his nostril to his lip, wiped it with his open hand, then continued to serve us as his nose ran, he wiped it into his palm, then handled our food and drinks. They have the audacity to charge $18/lb for crawfish after prices everywhere else dropped to $6/lb. The service was painfully slow, the waiter was miserable, the bathrooms atrocious, and the food was some of the worst I've ever had at a cost much too steep.

The only downside was they splashed vinegar in the lobster. It must be an acquired taste but not something I loved. Also the fries were overcooked and just not tasty.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMl9lTDZnRRAB,Boston,en,1758

"Came here today for a carry out order for a grilled chicken club sandwich.

Got the order and checked it for quantity and it looks good.

Got home and we discovered that the ""chicken"" did not make it into the container!!! I've had multiple mishaps (about 60%) from this location ranging from missing sandwiches, missing GF buns, and missing items - most of these I've actually let go. They do get it right sometimes and I do what I can to check the order to prevent it at the counter.

However, to have to open individual containers to make sure the chicken was there is going too bit much babysitting. We should expect a certain amount of quality. And the place wasn't even that busy today... The drive thru wasn't long and the dining area was not full.

It's hard to stay away from this location since it's the only one on the way but the service becomes a bit too much.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5enAteUlBEAE,Dallas,en,3819

The market does have seating nearby, if not there are park benches around the market as well, but I took it for pick up to a bar that does not serve food. I had the vegan crab cake po‚Äôboy which was good, so I can only imagine that the traditional crab cake po‚Äôboy is amazing as well! I would most definitely come back to try that out or any of the other delicious looking options. They had a variety of food options with a lot of traditional New Orleans fares as well like red beans, okra gumbo and beignets. So I would say this is a great place to try some true NOLA foods. Also, true to the NOLA spirit, they also sell alcohol! Yay!

"Would we return? Yes, absolutely

Traveling thru New Orleans, we were in search of a nice meal that was not a chain restaurant. Thai is one of our favorite ""genres"" of foods, so to speak.

A quick google search of restaurants near me yielded Thai Nola, and it had favorable images and reviews and a unique name.

This is a family-run restaurant, so that is a ++ in my book!

We had two Thai teas, which were very good, better than our local Thai place.

I ordered the Pad Thai medium spice, and it was actually the BEST Pad Thai plate that I have had! It had a great presentation, and wonderful flavor! Portion size VERY ample!

Wife had Thai Nola Boiled Shrimp: excellent presentation!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREc2ZITzJRRRAB,New Orleans,en,6205

I don't even write reviews. I don't have the time for that mess but imma surely make time for this one. First of all it's tacobell there's no real expectation for fast food. Still when you can't even throw some beans and cheese on a tortilright there's some issues. That definitely needs to be addressed. All I wanted was a few simple burritos. And what I got was that crap I ordered a chicken enchilada burrito and I only got a few small slivers of chicken. I don't understand how that passes as a proper made chicken enchiladas burrito. Especially given the fact you have a menu to guide you and a specific measurement scoop to give the exact amount everytime.that is wrong and disrespectful in so many levels.look I get it it i really do sometimes you just may not have the right amount to make the proper portion of an item pulled or maybe just out of stock. But that don't mean that you can make a person believe that they will be getting what they ordered. All I got was a rice and cheese with red sauce burrito. you couldve just said we dont have that item available at this time not make people pay for it anyway. You took my money and just slapped crap into a tortilla knowing thats not at all what i paid for WRONG AND UNPROFESSIONAL. There's a difference of making mistakes and just down right not doing it right just because you just dont care.

"I've frequented New China several times, but my experiences have often been marred by unpleasant interactions with some of the female staff members. Their demeanor often comes across as rude, which has been consistently off-putting.

Moreover, their ordering system, where they require a complete order before handing over the food, seems inefficient and unnecessary. This process would make more sense if there was an option to pre-pay to ensure the order matches the right customer. However, as it stands, it feels like an extra, pointless step that adds to the overall frustration.

I've also noticed a concerning pattern that suggests possible racial bias in the way customers are treated. This has been a recurring issue in my visits, leading me to question the inclusivity and customer service approach of the restaurant.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMUpTY1FnEAE,Cary,en,1860

I ate about 30% of it, hoping ""juicy"" would be in the middle somewhere.   I mentioned that to the other waiter (every table has 2) and he laughed like I was telling a joke.

The subtle complaint is lost on this place.   if you get poor quality like I did, I would recommend just sending it back.   Another oddity, they don't clear plates between courses.

Runner ups: The steamed pork buns. Stuffed with a good amount of meat inside, they were super fresh and soft. The basil popcorn chicken. So crispety and crunchy, and served piping hot. Egg rolls were different than traditional ones. Not as much of a cronch on them, but still good.

The char siu pork was sadly probably my least favorite item. It needs more char, and less of whatever sauce they're using, they need more of that traditional red sauce (see photos).

It turned out that the grits mixed well with the shrimp sauce and the melty cheese, which tasted a bit salty. The biscuit was a separate order, but I am glad that I ordered it because if I ate the grit alone it would be too salty for me. By the way, the biscuit was quite buttery but not fluffy enough.

"Never been disappointed as I am today, been coming here for 5 years to support this business because I genuinely enjoyed the food. Today that changed when a new young staff served me what seems to be left over pieces of shredded  chicken. I ordered the brown stew chicken with rice and peas and cabbage. As the server was making my large plate I asked her not to give me broken pieces. She gave me two small portions of whole chicken and the rest of it was broken shredded chicken which amounted to one extra piece of it had not been broken, so I paid for three pieces of chicken for what should have been a large which usually includes about 5 good pieces. Then she literally gave me one scoop of cabbage that were over cooked and needless to say I‚Äôm highly disappointed for her service. The owner was there but she is not approachable as she never smiles and always seems to just want to get people in and out her business. I think I will no longer support places like this although in the past I have enjoyed their food today was just trash of food service and poor quality of food. I took a pic of my served plate for reference.

"RAW BURGER!! AND DEALING WITH CODY WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!! Order my burger well done. They gave it to me bleeding. Called no customer service from Cody, just LIES AND THEFT!! he says he was the manager no apology for the experience just bring it back for your refund!!! $15 for a burger full of blood and a waste of time. Literally the burger pictured cause me to vomit..   NEVER AGAIN 

Cody is the WORST TYPE OF PERSON I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. HE LIED AND SAID HE WAS THE MANAGER!!!! He LIED. IF CODY TELLS YOU HE IS THE MANAGER HE IS LYING. Then he had me come all the way back to the Farm Burger on 14th street in Atlanta Midtown for a refund. When I get there he says I sent it to your card and THAT WAS A LIE.

The black with the dreads just paid me my refund in cash after arguing with the white dude CODY for 20 minutes. 20 minutes of lying about being the manager and sending a refund to my card. Why he acted like this, I have my suspicions however this is definitely one of the WORST PLACE to eat for lunch in Midtown.

"Starting with the positive ; staff was friendly and nice and the service was good  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Carmel might be the most contrived restaurant in Atlanta and it shows the minute you walk in .  The owner‚Äôs interpretation of ‚Äúa postcard to (from) ??? the coast ‚Äú feels like a 1980s Balkan‚Äôs cafeteria and is dim , sterile and oddly out of place . The cocktail menu is diverse but ask for details as the descriptions really don‚Äôt give a clear picture of what you are getting and we found the flavors to be just odd in three of them .  The wine by the glass is limited and overpriced . Food is divided into ‚Äúgems‚Äù second plates and main courses .  We decided to start off with about 5 plates to share .  The scallops were horrific and sliced horizontally in a milky broth that had no flavor ; a shrimp dish with peanuts was decent but weirdly presented with the heads detached from the tails and lined up on one side of the dish ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ We had three other items that were so unmemorable I have no idea what they were . We decided to skip ordering more and bailed around the corner to the Vietnamese restaurant bar for appetizers and drinks .

Highly recommend!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREal9TaTNRRRAB,New Orleans,en,6381

A very helpful and friendly staff awaits and attends throughout your experience.

Menu is not expansive but has a variety of options and all tantalizing and worth a view.

I‚Äôm not really looking but this place seems very stable as far as pricing goes and the quality of food and service has been 9 of 10 for around 30 years now.  Maybe more. Think about how many places have come and gone. I hope this place gets to stick around as long as they like. I guess it helps they only take cash and you dont pay a premium to a middle man and fancy app that makes throwing money out the window so easy. Just call, order and then pickup in 20 minutes and have some spare change to pay your credit debt. It‚Äôll help you digest your breakfast.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGamJQTGR3EAE,Boston,en,1146

We were trying to tell her what was happening and she snapped at the other car and then snapped at me when taking my order.  I was not rude chalked it up to a bad day.
Got my order and the drink size was wrong, the guy was nice and was making it right.  When I went to get my drink it was a girl handing me the drink, I am in a very low sports car and it was 9pm, she was handing it to me carefully which I thought was odd but when I went to place it in my cup holder realized there was no lid as it spilled all over me and my dash board.  When I turned around the guy was back in the window horrified handing me napkins and the lid saying he was sorry!  The girl was walking off...the guy said something to her and when she spoke I recognized her voice as the one taking my order.  Called and chatted with a shift manager that was nice and was wanting me to speak to the manager cause he stated this has happened before.  Manager has yet to call back and it has been a week.

My first visit when I got a second bowl, I had accidentally thrown my spoon away so I asked for another one.  The older lady with the black hair in a ponytail with bangs pointed to the eating area.  I went to get a spoon.  However, the spoons were stationed on top of the trash.  I went back to the counter and asked for a spoon.  She aggressively pointed to the dining area.  I told her that I don't want a spoon from the trash area.  She reluctantly gave me one from behind the counter.

The second visit was similar.  This time, I ordered.  She gave me a pen and receipt to sign for the purchase after, I used my credit card.

However the music is LOUD and can be explicit which doesn‚Äôt make a great family friendly place even before it gets dark. Even more unfortunate we were seated right by the DJ booth.

Due to the loud music we ended up getting a couple of apps and drinks rather than a whole meal. Apps and drinks were great. Staff was kind. Just unfortunately the atmosphere is really unappealing.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dVpLQzhnRRAB,New Orleans,en,5483
"I paid nearly $16 for a burrito with scrambled eggs and overly fried tater torts. The expectation when you buy a meal in an airport is that it will be inflated in price and underwhelming, so that wasn't the issue. However, there were no employees at the front of house taking orders at the register. There were a couple of kiosks where I first tried to place my order, but the item I wanted to order came with bacon and there was no option to remove this on the kiosk. I waited for about 5 minutes for someone to come out and help me with my order. When the employee finally did come out she asked ""did everyone order at the kiosk?"" When I said I did not she said ""okay order at the kiosk."" Then walked away again. Then I waited a little longer for her to come back. I then explained I needed to request no bacon on the burrito I was trying to order and there was no option to do this on the kiosk. She verbally confirmed and walked away. So I went ahead and placed the order at the kiosk and it came out with no bacon, but also no pico de Gallo. So overall, very poor customer service and the staff, and an incorrect, overpriced, order.

OK y'all this ones gonna be a long one. I am so so happy I found this lil hidden in plain sight gem! We went for bae's birthday and let me tell you this place did not disappoint! From when we walked in we were amazed at the instant vibe. It's a wonderful size restaurant and beautifully decorated. There were a few people but it was fairly empty and our waitress told us we could pick our own seats. We opted to sit as close to the fireplace area as possible. I mentioned to our wonderful waitress that it was bae's birthday and she smiled and winked at me. From beginning to end our waitress was perfect! She showed the right amount of attention to us without being overbearing and annoying. She took her time explaining the menu and drink menu. (We're always looking for the strongest drinks on the menu lol)The menu has something wonderful for every one's price range. I went with the lamb chops and brussel sprouts(y'all know how much I love the sprouts) bae went with the salmon and veggies with mashed potatoes. While waiting for our food the bartender came over with complimentary glasses of Rose(idk if they do that all the time so don't go there expecting it and being mad at me if they don't lol) and it was dry and delicious we were pleasantly shocked lol. Then the food came and everything was perfectly seasoned and phenomenal! They really show you love and take care of you in there! They have happy hour from 4-7 so needless to say we will def be checking that out very soon! While we were sitting and talking the waitress came by and asked if we wanted to take pictures by the piano(insert happy face) she even remembered it was his bday and brought him a complimentary piece of cheesecake which was also delish and sang him happy birthday all by herself.

"Okay y'all, when I tell you I had my doubts.... They were absolutely unfounded.

This place was AMAZING. Everything, the food, service, ambiance, bathroom, and cocktails.

I brought my brunch bunch in this last Saturday for the bottomless deal. We had a 12 top and never wanted for a thing!

I was actually SURPRISED at how effective the mimos were, despite the fact that they mixed them for you (not my favorite thing and I had called ahead and was told they specifically DID NOT DO THIS, but it all turned out to be just fine).

Everything everyone ate was DEVINE. Not a single complaint to be had by my party of 12. That's quite a feat. I was having so much fun I didn't even get pictures of the food!

I had the boudin has, delicious but the star of the show (besides of course our AMAZING, SWEET, PATIENT, BUTT KICKING server, Tara ?I think)) was the crawfish pie. It was more like a pot pie, with poached eggs. Absolutely DELICIOUS. And sooooo my charbroiled oysters to choose from!

At some point there was gumbo and beignets too... Mmmm!

This place is right around the corner from my job and I will definitely be back! Thanks Trenasse!

2024 update- I have been back multiple times for both brunch and dinner and honestly everything is just as amazing every time. The service, the food, the ambiance... It just all hits even the price points! Don't sleep on the oyster log!!!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bmVPbmpRRRAB,New Orleans,en,6121

"The service is decent and the space clean.  The music is a little loud, I couldn't imagine wanting to sit here and chat on a date.  I guess that's why the place isn't too packed on a sunny afternoon.
Anyhow on to the important part: the food.

The burgers are overcooked to well done, greasy, and flavorless! If they're seasoned, I couldn't tell- they were so bland. And the tots were too crispy and oily. I attached a photo of the oil left behind. The bottom is where the tots were.  At the end I was left with an oily after taste, and a slight allergic reaction- I think the burger had mayo, which I don't eat often.  But I had mayo last week, and didn't have the same reaction.
If you want an over-priced greasy burger- still don't come here.  You can get a better overpriced burger someplace else.

I should also add that someone let their half-eaten burger behind on another table- which I wish I saw before ordering.  It looked like a heap of uninspired disappointment in a bun.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeXZTX2h3RRAB,New York,en,4377

"I hate these kind of reviews.

Hostess waved across the room to seat me, no instructions. I sit quietly for several minutes waiting on someone to take my order. A server shows up with no water or coffee. She informs me i have to order online via QR code. (Why have a server?) QR code menu doesn't match the advertising. Said advertisement is why I stopped to eat. You have to order and pay online while still expected to tip a server. Online payment portal messed up. Server told me I didn't pay for coffee. I apologized. I went back into the payment portal and reentered my info and card info to pay for the coffee. The portal now wants to charge me for two coffees. I ask the server to just take the coffee away. She does. She returns to say I've already paid for the coffee and can bring it back. Sigh. I decline, choosing to eat dryly some food I didn't want in the first place just to get on with my life.

Look at my reviews. I'm not given to negativity. But this restaurant ----.  You don't have the right culture. Your process is unfriendly, frustrating, and borderline combative.

"I wanted to relax from the cool weather outside on my way home. So I went to New Capitol Restaurant. I ordered from here before, and I thank God that they serve breakfast dishes in the evening. So I ordered 1 French Toast Special (Scrambled Eggs, Bacon and Home Fries) and 1 Orange Juice. I ate breakfast for dinner comfortably in peace while watching television, something I haven‚Äôt done since the start of the digital age three years ago. It is wonderful how people can find new ways to connect by searching for opportunities online. I enjoyed the service, from the waiter serving me very friendly to the compassionate clerk by the entrance of the restaurant. I was about to take the glass with me by accident, but at least I was able to get the energy to go home.

On another evening, I stopped by to get the soup of the day. The waitress mentioned clam chowder, so I immediately ordered for the night. It was delicious. Good for the soul in the early winter days of the new year.

"Very disappointing experience at this restaurant. My family was visiting from out of town and heard good things about this place. We walked in after spending the morning at the Dallas aquarium. We ordered a burger, wedge salad, hot dog, and chicken sandwich. It took about an hour for all our food to come out and at three separate times. My son‚Äôs burger was brought out first (by mistake from another table‚Äôs order) and our server ended up saying he could keep it and our food would be out shortly. About 20 minutes later by the time my son was finished my salad arrived. We were still missing my husband and daughter‚Äôs food. I went ahead and ate my salad and when I was finishing my lunch the rest of the food arrived. This was about 45 minutes after our order had been placed and the restaurant was not busy by any means. The hot dog had mustard on it which we had told the server to omit when we placed our order. When asked if we could get a new hot dog with just ketchup as originally ordered and keep the fries (our daughter was so hungry at this point) the server seemed annoyed. She brought us a new hot dog within a few minutes‚Ä¶drowning in ketchup, about 3 times the amount that was on the original hot dog, looking sloppy and gross overall. They were clearly annoyed we had requested a new one. This place has a fun overall bar atmosphere and an area for a live band. Maybe for a night out drinking it‚Äôs great but for a family meal they totally missed the mark.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dXNXWENnEAE,Dallas,en,3264

"I love _SO_ many things about this place. Delicious food, never crowded for lunch, and quick service.

When I asked to drop the music volume from an 8 to a 7, I was told that the decibel level is set by corporate and cannot be changed. Disappointing!

The main person who takes orders most of the time is not friendly\outgoing, and that is disappointing.

And the last time, instead of the unhappiness, my friend and I were met with a kiosk, which is understandable, but with no person at the register, he had to order (slowly), then me. The hope is that next time they will have TWO kiosks so we can order simultaneously.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcmJmemNREAE,Atlanta,en,730

"From 3:00 to 7:00 p.m. there is a 3 entree deal for $31. It could feed a family quite well or have enough for a few meals. I have gotten this three times so far, trying different things each time. They also give me a container of their soup of the day (think broth with some meat and greens,) and a container with rice.

So filling! Also the order comes out pretty quickly. I have not called in yet but it only takes about 10 to 15 minutes for them to fix up your order. There is indoor seating but I haven't seen too many people sit inside, I imagine they have more takeout than anything.

Did you not serve alcohol like most Chinese eateries. I only included this because I overheard a patron asking if there was beer.

If you are in the area stop by and try it out! It isn't bougie. I would say it's not too healthy but oh so delicious. If you are taking public transportation the 8/8bx and 9/9r run along Sunnydale and Visitacion and both stop at Arleta, just a few blocks away.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtLXBiUFFREAE,San Francisco,en,4685

"Blanche Reynold's mansion holds significant historical value, much like many other establishments in the Myers Park area. The mansion features items imported from Cuba in the 1920s, adding to its cultural richness. Opting to park in the lot on Fenton Place rather than the one off Providence, especially the back parking lot, is advisable. The expansive patio offers a charming outdoor space, yet navigating the premises can be intricate, particularly when entering from the rear parking lot. Despite the establishment's reputation for its drinks and margaritas, the margarita experience fell short of expectations. It appears that my margarita (pitcher of Friend Zone) may have been non-alcoholic or contained minimal alcohol content. The perceived lack of value for the $42 expenditure is disappointing, as the drink resembled a mere juice consumption experience. I deeply regret not opting for the bottle of wine instead. The Billy Ray Valentine, however, proved to be exceptional. The enhanced queso dip, complimented by chorizo and sweet relish corn, was a culinary delight. The chicken fajitas (I'm Your Wingman), accompanied by cilantro lime rice, spring mix, queso, black beans, and sour cream, were a standout dish. Unfortunately, I was too full to indulge in the tres leches dessert, but it undoubtedly would have been delightful. The service provided by Adrianna was exemplary! Notably, the establishment does not provide straws, so it is advisable to bring your own if needed. I am taking off 2 stars for the Margarita Pitcher.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqeko3QmR3EAE,Charlotte,en,2670

"This is such a unique location in New Orleans. Picture the French Market but nicer, cleaner, and enclosed.

There are several restaurants within St. Roch that serve Cuban, Mexican, Japanese, and Cajun food (more than that). Everything I've had here is delicious (albeit a little expensive, especially if you get a drink).

Besides food, St. Roch is also a great studying location. The building has plenty of windows and tables, making it perfect for work. There's also a wonderful coffee shop as well that serves delicious drinks and pastries.

Also, the service here is wonderful. Although each booth has its own employees (they're okay) the stars of the show are the St. Roch ""waiters."" They constantly clean the tables and make sure you have iced, filtered water along with your meal.

The gumbo soup was bitter.  The duck was chewy--normal. I informed Gabrielle I found the soup bitter. She did not respond to my query until I asked twice, and she said the roux is very dark but not burnt.

If a gumbo tastes bitter the roux is burned.

The bread and butter was delicious.

"Parking: There is a nearby parking lot for $3/hour (maximum of 3 hours). There is street/metered parking (difficult to find).

We discovered this place after deciding not to wait on the waitlist for Szechuan Mountain House.

Service: Service was good. We were greeted and seated immediately.

Atmosphere: I really liked the decor/ambiance. Really clean/modern look.

Food: The portion sizes were rather small and on the more expensive end. We ordered various dishes and the presentation of the food was great.

Abalone - This was good. Had a citrus taste to it. The price of this was discounted when we went (not sure if this will remain at a discounted price for future visits)

Dragon Maki - Tasted good but nothing above and beyond. Comparable to any other sushi restaurant.

Agedashi Tofu - This was good. Again, nothing above and beyond. Can get this anywhere and will be comparable.

Takoyaki - Underwhelming. The bottom of the ball appeared to be flat.

Tori Karaage - Underwhelming. Can get fried chicken anywhere.

Lava Stone A5 Wagyu - The meat was tender but was tasteless. Portion size was really small and definitely not worth the $36. Better off getting 2-3 more rolls instead of this.

Oyako Don - Underwhelming. Nothing stood out and you wont be missing out if you go anywhere else that offers this.

Seafood Yaki Udon - This was good. The sauce was good. It wasnt too oily. Definitely above average for udon.

Ice Cream - Complementary at the end. This was also good. Only had the options of matcha or vanilla.

Verdict: I would recommend coming here to try it out however this is definitely not the spot to go to if you are looking for dinner/something to fill you up. Place is more like a spot for lunch.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOZ2N5SUx3EAE,New York,en,3975

"The quality of food at Ruth Chris has gone down. My ribeye  had no flavor. The only part that was good was the fat. I have eaten at Ruth Chris a few times and this was my husband first time. He said we won't be going back. His red snapper looked like a baby tilapia and he said it was distasteful along with the bed of rice. We did like our calamari appetizer and the creamed spinach was good. Also, my wine was good (Vietti). If we try Ruth Chris again it will be in North Hills. This one was a huge disappointment when I was craving a flavorful steak.

Our server was good and attentive. There were two managers that walked around checking on guests and seemed engaged, however, one of them was selective in who he approached. We were in a more private area and he consistently went to the other two tables but didn't ever come to my husband and I table. He should be careful with behavior like that.

Asked for a 4 piece combo. Was given the wrong order when I  asked specifically for wings and was given tenders. Tenders are soggy and flubbery in the middle. Unacceptable for a paying customer that left a tip. Cannot eat soggy tenders that I didn't ask for. Also skimped out on fries and gave me a half order. Was not given a drink until I asked. Saw the lady that took my order give herself and fill her cup too. Asked me specifically what I ordered for the 4 piece and I told her wings. She gave me tenders that I can't even eat. I feel this was deliberately done after I told her wings after she asked what kind of combo.server was named Daisy. Unacceptable for a customer that was a fan but won't he returning anymore unless I get a refund for the 20 dollars I spent for an incorrect order. They probably won't care anyways.

"I can‚Äôt eat at Yawdi anymore. Every time I‚Äôm in there they are out of oxtail and items on the menu (at the restaurant). Today I saw them at an event and ran up to ask if the oxtail was in stock. It was. I now know why. It was a $25 plate. I was happy to support. At checkout the girl adds 18% tip to my purchase and tried to just skip through to have me sign. I'm staring at the handheld machine thinking, ""did she just put 18% on my order and not at least tell me??"" They get my food together and then she realizes she didn‚Äôt add my side of plantains I ordered. So it's going to be another $5. I watch her the second time and sure enough i see her pause and then quickly select the 18% again.  So then i ask her. She said a bunch stuff that makes absolutely no sense ""it's going to charge you $5 so im fixing it‚Ä¶"" Sure. I finally look at her realizing she's not disclosing how shes pricing all of this and isn't going to tell me the truth. I get home, eat my side of plantains, they're what I wanted. I open up my plate and I'm dumbfounded. Half the plate is rice. I tried it, it was ok. I thought it was meant to be a side, but it was most of the styrofoam container. I try the mac n cheese. Meh‚Ä¶it was not worth the dairy issues to eat it (for me). My mom and I do make really good mac though, so I'm bougie lol. But the OXTAIL wad an afterthought! I got three tiny chunks of bone in the sides section. It was about 4 bites of meat‚Äînot even 4 oz. ü§Ø The four bites were delicious, but it was four bites for like almost $30!? I dont even feel like trying to eat the rest. So I'm done. I've tried to reason and revisit this place but it's always some humbug.

"A Friendly Visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles

I had been eagerly anticipating my first visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles, so I arrived bright and early on a Sunday morning at 9:45 am, only to realize that they don't open until 10 am ‚Äì my bad for not double-checking the hours beforehand! But arriving early turned out to be a blessing, as a small line had already formed outside, and more folks were joining in anticipation of a delicious breakfast.

Once seated, I ordered a glass of water, coffee, and orange juice. However, my excitement dipped momentarily when I noticed some food crumbs in my water. Nonetheless, I decided to give the menu a good look, settling on a waffle with maple pecan-infused butter and the American breakfast.

The waffle, accompanied by its unique buttery topping, was decent, but not quite the flavor explosion I had hoped for. The American breakfast, unfortunately, didn't quite hit the mark either ‚Äì the turkey bacon was a tad bland, and the sausage patties seemed a bit overdone. But hey, the buttery grits were surprisingly tasty!

To my disappointment, the coffee arrived on the colder side and lacked the robust flavor I was expecting. Despite these minor setbacks, when the bill arrived, I couldn't help but feel it was a tad steep for the overall dining experience.

In the end, while my visit to Dames Chicken and Waffles didn't entirely live up to my expectations, I left with a hopeful outlook. I'm confident that with a bit of attention to cleanliness and perhaps some tweaks to the menu, this charming spot has the potential to provide an even more delightful dining experience for its future guests.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMHJPSTh3RRAB,Cary,en,1844

"While strolling the heart of Bourbon Street, stride into a world of refined elegance at Galatoire's in New Orleans, where over 100 years of tradition converge with exquisite culinary craftsmanship. From the moment you enter through its French doors, you are enveloped in an atmosphere of sophistication and old-world charm. You are treated to a dining experience that is both traditional and refined, a true celebration of Louisiana's rich culinary heritage*. Impeccable service and classic Creole dishes await each bite a testament to the restaurant's commitment to excellence. It is a place where tradition meets innovation and where every meal is an unforgettable celebration of food, family, and community.

What I Tasted: The appetizer quartet showcased flavors from the indulgent crab maison to the crispy fried oysters. For the main course, fresh local saut√©ed fish adorned with seasonal crawfish Etouff√©e. The fish had a delicate yet rich flavor profile that melted in your mouth. The optional lemon caper beurre blanc sauce, with champagne, was the perfect complement to the fish, adding a velvety smoothness and subtle acidity and saltiness to each bite.

 Standout Feature: their unwavering dedication to preserving Creole traditions while infusing modern flair sets it apart. With every bite, you are transported to a bygone era of refined dining, where the vibrant culture of Louisiana comes to life.

 What Was Mid: While some may find the classic decor and attentive service charming, others may perceive it as slightly rigid or stuffy. It has all the qualities of rigid service, former attire, and feeling of exclusive clientele but without the real upscale elegance of refined dining elements However, whether the ambiance suits your taste is subjective and may depend on your dining preference.

"Aroma Restaurant & Sushi Bar menu outside the restaurant convinced us to go inside. Not Sushi eaters but the Teriyaki Chicken caught our eye.

Welp I hit my 600K now Can ya'll the original number goal I had in my head ????
Hint I didn't hit it yet....

@kendrickclone70 and I spent the day on some going to see our doctors to make sure our health is on point. And coming out one of our appointments we notice this restaurant across the street @aromarestaurantt which is listed Aroma Restaurant and Sushi Bar as we are reading the menu in the window. And the Teriyaki Chicken caught our eyes. So we pulled up.
As we are seated by a latin waitress with a nice size BBL I look around the restaurant and all the waitresses are latin with BBL's BBL's. Now I am wondering is BBL's mandatory for them to get a job there. We ordered both our Teriyaki Chicken and when they came out plated so nice. And the food was delicious. And what actually brings this restaurant over the top for me was not the BBL's and the abundance of latin woman.
The top for me was the simple glass of water. The water was a ice cold and even though it was in a cocktail glass our waitresses yes waitresses kept my glass refilled over and over and over. I added the lime and by the time I was finished eating my slow self lunch my mucous (pause) was no longer bothering me in my chest.

Bar atmosphere and pretty low key place with tight parking and dangerous getting out of the lot.  $40 for two burgers - pretty pricey.  Clam chowder was not good.

It is 100% most definitely SURIMI, which is IMITATION CRAB made out of fish. Restaurants are not even allowed to advertise one type of meat but switch it for another.

The flatbread left a lot to be desired. The one I ordered was supposed to come with pesto and EVOO, and very noticeable the pesto was missing. When I asked the bartender about it, she told me that it didn't come with pesto when it very clearly stated that it did on the menu.

Because she did not pick up her food, the restaurant messaged her saying...

in my face, I asked to speak to a manager and she told me there wasn‚Äôt a manager there and that ‚Äú he was on vacation‚Äù then she blocked my number on the store phone.

"Amazing restaurant and incredible food. We first stopped here because we were working in the area and it was lunch and it caught my eye. I've never been to a Pollo Regio before and after we came here one time I couldn't belive what I had been missing out on. The Half Chicken is out of this world its so good, after one trip it became the benchmark for chicken I get from anywhere I go. It's always 'this chicken is good, but it's not as good as Pollo Regio.' I am grateful to Emma and Angie because they make it a wonderful experience when we come by, and we have come by 3 or 4 times a week when we are working in town because the food is that good and the atmosphere is so inviting. The Half Chicken is amazing, but everything else is great too, and it all pairs amazing with their chips and the Verde salsa! Thanks so much to everyone here on the Pollo Regio team.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqc3BLR0RBEAE,Dallas,en,3660

It IS a little hard to find, but look for the signage where the shopping center ""elbows.""  ...Steps down to the lover level service lane get you there from the front, and it's at the bottom of the big hill on the service lane coming from Park Rd. Can't miss it, but you may have to ""explore"" the area behind the center.  Many shops and other places on the lower level.  Good times!!!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5Z1luaTd3RRAB,Charlotte,en,2382

"The food here is mediocre at best.
Service was not bad.  But overall it seems like everyone that works there has given up.

The brown butter gnocchi was literally swimming in butter and drowned in walnuts.  Apparently pecans and walnuts are the same thing.  Really disappointing.

Had the Tournedo Rossini as a main.  Asked for medium rare.  Got a grey hunk of tenderloin. The mushrooms were soggy and flavorless.  Even the fois was kinda tasteless.

"This was a favorite of ours. This was top place we would bring visitors. As you see my previous review. Today we decided to try breakfast. The service was awful. The food was disgusting. I have had better waffle at hotel  continental breakfast than this. The potatoe wedges were nothing but grease. This was one of my worst experiences at reasturant. The waiter showed no care about our meal. I will not say what I saw in the bathroom. That was absolutely disgusting. It truly was sad how they showed no care in our experience.  If they showed care about it. We would chalk up as off day. It could been handled so differently. I have spent well Over 24 years in customer service. Then to boot we got home and realized there was 9.90 tip when we said no tip on the screen. We were told it was our mistake. To end it If you try it best of luck. I will NEVER visit this reasturant again.  This is absolutely awful service.  Truly disappointed how everything was handled.

This was our second time here. The food is great. It is fresh and quality and most everything is house made. The pretzel is must try. The atmosphere is great and the outdoor seating is great. The staff is very friendly. Highly recommend this place it's worth it.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlZ08yY29nRRAB,Cary,en,2159

"What a delight! I highly recommend the soups, we had the Caldo de Res and el pozole, but everything else we had, including the nachos con carne, quesadillas with mushrooms, and chilaquiles with two fried eggs, were excellent.
The waters (jamaica/hibiscus and tamarindo/tamarind) are made from scratch, and you can tell. The virgin pi√±a colada was a favorite for my kid and the hot, cozy, and cinnamon-y champurado drink was perfect on the colder night we were there.
The service was also wonderful. Our kind and very fast server checked in on us and would sometimes preemptively know our needs. What more could you ask for!
