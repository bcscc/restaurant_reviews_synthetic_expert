This place all around just trash,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENEkzU2ZnEAE,New Orleans,en,6566
"I feel my food was rushed cooked and wasn‚Äôt prepared right and this is why I ordered Nandocas Choice, it‚Äôs a chicken sandwich which is supposed to come with coleslaw on it, & they didn‚Äôt put any coleslaw on the sandwich,  the sandwich was so dry even with the peri-peri sauce, it shocked me because I never headed it that way, this was a horrible eating experience, I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy my food. I guess it‚Äôs better when you eat in and you can catch the mistakes faster.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOXZMUURnEAE,Washington,en,5260
"Excellent ambience, food and service. Very quick to serve, good food (including desert), the neighborhood looks nice too.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNmRPYnB3RRAB,Charlotte,en,2638
"Had a 5:30pm reservation, didn‚Äôt get our appetizer until a half hour later, sat for an hour and and a half without our third appetizer, or entrees, had to leave due to another commitment never thinking a dinner would consume two hours of our evening. All the while them pushing us to get more drinks. My advice is to skip New Orleans all together. Bunch of scum bags over here.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREM2E2R3RRRRAB,New Orleans,en,5497
I just didn't care for it at all. The fries were cold and disgusting and the wings were mediocre at best. ugh ü§Æ,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxOGZYS09REAE,Atlanta,en,330
"I only go for soup coco bread/beef patties and ice cream and it's good..but today I went right before noon and got a patty with cocoa bread and cheese and the cocoa bread was definitely stale the cheese was just placed on the bun instead of inside the patty which would have been just luscious you know.. I don't know what happened today hopefully it's just a day and they'll be better tomorrow

Update 9/9/21
I went to get a patty coco bread and cheese.. I was second guessing because I didn't want to have the same experience..but I didn't and It was good.. I also realized that the person who heated up my previous patty overheated it #dontdothat
Never again.. 4-4-24
Ordered chicken soup.. we t I went to taste it all I taste is spice but that wasn't the real issue. The fact that I received a pea sized piece of chicken made me upset.. especially after spending 7.00 bucks.. I called and told a womeuthe issue,she was nice.. told me to bring it back & so I did. When I got in my car I opened it and was even more disappointed  I don't even know if it was chicken she gave me (I'll post Pic when I'm able) just horrible.. the food game is going down fast..if the Passion is gone #retire",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dlBUckdBEAE,Boston,en,1360

"Jake, the bartender, was super friendly and greeted us with a special refreshing lemon and cucumber vodka or gin concoction for our anniversary at the bar to start. Shaq was an amazing server and gave us great food recommendations. He had a great attitude. Jessie brought us a trio of focaccia bread that was too die for to start. These 3 made us feel very important and filled our evening with their warm smiles and positive attitudes. The fresh ravioli seafood pasta inspired by Venice is what I really enjoyed. It was mouth watering. For dessert, the chocolate bombe, tiramisu and coffee copa ice cream were all so yummy. I can't wait to eat here again the next time I visit Atlanta.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEalpETkp3EAE,Atlanta,en,205

I originally left 5 stars with a raving review and pics from here but they‚Äôve gone downhill. I lowered my rating to 3 stars last week because they didn‚Äôt send a whole combo in my order and then told me to take it up with Uber. I thought let me give them another shot so I ordered from here and they didn‚Äôt send one of my food items again. Honestly they need to do better.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaUlxN1ZREAE,New York,en,4221

I came here one day for lunch and the food was delicious. The fajitas had to be some of the best I‚Äôve tasted. My waiter was Chris and he was so nice and helpful.

"Staff barely acknowledged our presence, and it appears that had friends there with personal items in all the booths so no one could sit down.
I was stupid and didn't check my order, as I confirmed with the staff it was correct and of course it was wrong but I didn't notice until I got back to my hotel.
They said, ""If that's how she rang it up, that's how I made it.""
And the corn pup was so over fried I couldn't bite into it, and the fries weren't much better.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dE1qQktBEAE,Atlanta,en,426

HORRIBLE!!! Drove a hour and a half for my daughter‚Äôs birthday celebration for it to be a complete DISASTER! Reservations were made on April 12th for April 20th @6:45pm. Arrived checked in was told there was a 15 minute wait. After waiting 35 minutes I went to the restroom and asked the host again how much longer cause it‚Äôs pushing a hour he said 15 more minutes. After another 30 minutes went back in to be told out his mouth ‚Äú yeah I lied to yall ‚Äù with a laugh and proceeded to tell security to tell us we can GTFO. Wasn‚Äôt seated until8.45pm just to have to wait another 30 minutes for waitress and chef who services other tables who sat down after us. Now this mommy is having to replan another birthday experience to make up for this one. We were told this man name was RYAN,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNXMtTkpREAE,Atlanta,en,378

"Such a cool restaurant! It was very busy but we didn‚Äôt have to wait to be seated. Friendly service and we received our food super quick.

The Gator Bites were our favorite, served with a really good honey mustard sauce (and I‚Äôm not usually a fan of honey mustard). The Jumbalaya had a ton of flavor and was a pretty big portion.

Cafe Flora is a lovely restaurant with a garden feel. The menu has diversity and hits many popular favorites. We tried the oyster mushroom and leek pizza on the gluten free crust and it was tasty. The use of crushed almonds was particularly interesting. We also had the burger and sweet potato fries which met expectations. We finished it off with golden milk tea.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwaE5hMk9BEAE,Seattle,en,4856

"Got 3 dishes off vegan menu for take out: red curry tofu, drunken noodles and basil stir fry all requested hot. Red curry was decent though tasted like curry paste was from a can and mild. The drunken noodles and basil were tasteless with no spice and no depth of flavor. Food was not ready on time and prices are high.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMjVHcEFREAE,Atlanta,en,213

I ordered chicken and broccoli but sadly it was soggy with grease. The chicken was so soft it was mushy. I wish I could give a better rating but my food was submerged in sauces to the point that even the rice was drenched.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkazZINWpRRRAB,New York,en,4381
Good service. I would have to say my bowl was okay for the price which I got on special for $10. My spouse had the tuna and seem to like it. I did find it to be kind of bland and probably needed more sauce. I would come back and try other options if I'm in the area.  So on a positive note we can say it tasted very healthy and had good value.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcXRIRjJ3RRAB,San Francisco,en,4547

The food has been prepared fresh each time I come here. The staff are friendly and the wings and fries are amazing! I‚Äôve tried the hot honey wings and spicy teriyaki and both were sauced well and unique in taste compared to other popular wing spots. Much better actually! Maybe made in-house? The sauce does not taste generic and the texture of the wings are always perfect. The prices and wait times are not bad either. There is a smoke shop attached with equally friendly and helpful staff. He took his time assisting me with my questions and went above and beyond to find answers if he was unsure. I always try to stop by when I‚Äôm in the area and will return and suggest your business to others.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKdV91QldREAE,Charlotte,en,2536

"We were looking for something different, and we're thinking oysters. We decided to check the big easy oven and tap as their website looked amazing. We live 45 minutes to an hour away but we're going to be in the area so we decided to try it. We pulled up and it looked like the place was empty, but there was actually a few people at the bar. We ordered drinks and fried calamari to start and the drinks were good, the calamari was decent, but overdone and a little chewy. My wife got the catfish po' boy and she really liked it. Fries were very good as well. I got the taste of New Orleans and for $17 I felt very jipped. They give you three little cups of rice with a little of each offering on top. Rice and beans, gumbo and jambalaya. Three tiny fried shrimp on the side. Outside of the shrimp, the three cups of the other things were just warm. One almost cold. Needless to say we were not impressed. The atmosphere is dated and the bathrooms are absolutely horrible! This place is a candidate for a bar rescue from John Tapper! It has potential but falls way short of what they show on their website",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcHVIMU13EAE,Cary,en,1953
"Edit: as of July 16th 2023 still closed :(

Super good. Good service. Always nice. But haven‚Äôt been open in weeks. There‚Äôs been a sign on the door for 3 weeks or maybe more that says 8/8/23 to 8/8/15. Idk what that means, I was there before the 23rd of July and it was closed. And then says closed for vacation. I hope they open back up soon because they are good but have tried to go many times and the sign is still up and a few months ago had to same thing. Very confusing as it says open online and the phone still rings and voicemail said open with the hours so have drove there for nothing.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNVBiN01REAE,New Orleans,en,6446

"Went there for a dance event/day party, & did exactly what we were there for, Dance! Beau's has a really nice size dance floor.
It was my first time there & didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at the setup as I walked in.  The look inside takes you off guard since the outside looks like it would be the restaurant it may have been at one time. However, when walking in, it was all about the dance floor for me, & the seating around it.
I didn't eat or drink, so I can only speak on the atmosphere, the setup, and the floor, which were all Great... Again, much to my surprise. Great job Beauregard's!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKcHN2djZRRRAB,Charlotte,en,2546

Ceviche mixto was a little too sour to my liking but the overall component went together well and balanced things out. I also like that there were a lot of raw onions in there, but it didn't taste too onion-y that you'd end up with onion breath.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREN1lXZjlBRRAB,Boston,en,1541

I was there today 2/20/24 and it just didn't feel the same kinda cold and discomfort wasn't that good ole down home feeling. Then came the shock of my life at Lil V's the lady gave a lady 3 ribs cut in half chopped and sliced for a rib sandwich, then I ask for a rib sandwich well she gave me 2 and started cutting in half? I say ma'am you just gave the other person 3 and she told me I got a different meat than her but, the rib was the same piece she just cut from. So I walked out, still don't understand what she was talking about. My last time going there until it changes back to the original Lil V.

"My grandparents made a reservation for brunch on 4/14. We were greeted by a sweet hostess but then was soon bombarded by another employee, who we soon found out was one of the managers, Brian. Pushy, unprofessional, insulting manager. Was talking down to his staff as if they‚Äôre all idiots.
I could go in detail about what else he did during the entire time we were there (because there was a lot) but what really set me off is when he gave my grandparents and my fianc√© and I check, while trying to walk away, he told us to basically learn how to make a reservation better next time. My fianc√© stopped him from leaving and asked him to repeat himself and the manager stated because my sweet grandfather called to make our reservation and did not use their website, that‚Äôs why they weren‚Äôt aware we were there for the brunch event.

Sweet and sour chicken was great.  There is a surcharge if using your card btw. She gave me my receipt.  I noticed the taxes were off. She only gave me receipt to card machine.  I asked for a detailed receipt. Then I noticed the charge. I asked her why she didn't tell me. She said it's on the wall. Rudely. I asked for a side of gravy. She asked what kind? I said brown. What other kind of gravy you have? She said we have other sauces. I said ma'am I didn't ask for sauce.  Sweet and sour chicken was delicious .  But I'm not paying a Surcharge for using my card. It was over 5 dollars as merchants are not charged with a min purchase. Since I rarely carry cash. I will eat at Hans.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURac01mTlNBEAE,Atlanta,en,1000

"This is my first review for a restaurant in my life. Delivery driver Siu Yan lost his temper on me in public because my messages were full, but I have a screenshot proving I called him and that was a literal two minute difference between his first call and my being at his vehicle, I tipped almost $5 for a 0.3 mile ride. The guy hit the gas and sped off in the middle of my taking the food from him and apologizing, he yelled at me for not answering the phone?! Usually good food and service, I have been a regular for a few years now and had no issue with them at all in any way, it has always been great. I haven't had another adult give sass like a little girl before, but I'll be going elsewhere from now on.

Considering the restaurant? Go inside and see for yourself how Clean it is. I have pictures of that too since it was the topic of discussion at our family's house that we worried the place was a tad dirty, but they knew us by name and were always nice. Too bad really. I will find the photos today and post them here.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0cjh1V3VBRRAB,Boston,en,1504

"Menu is a bit ""limited"", but I got the steak and potatoes, and it has definitely surpassed my expectations. Portions were definitely enough for me.

Steak, I'd give a solid 7.5, maybe 8/10. Good texture. Good taste. Very good. Would recommend.

Mashed Potatoes, I've had a lot of places that had very mediocre mashed potatoes where I would just leave it on my plate, but these mashed potatoes with the gravy were pretty good and I finished all of it. Perfect amount of gravy for the mashed potatoes, too. 7-7.5/10.

Carrots, I'm not a fan of carrots generally speaking. For carrots, these were good. Like 6/10 above average good. But the entire time I was eating the carrots, I just thought to myself, ""I wish these were sweet potatoes... but maybe that's just too much potato in the entree"".

Adding this place to my mental list of ""places to go to for a good steak"". I'm definitely going to have my family and friends try this place to get their opinions as well as try their other dishes.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREX0xyYWd3RRAB,Boston,en,1112

I wish they had not grilled it so hard. It wasn't bad and it wasn't the best either. However I did love the mushroom Demi. That was delicious to eat with sea meatloaf and especially in the mashed potatoes. I thoroughly enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the mushroom Demi. That was delicious. The Ambiance is very nice.

Cafe Con Leche provides serviceable Cuban food. The Con Leche sandwich has good flavor. Passeo Caribbean is about a half mile north on 1st and provides bigger  messier sandwiches for about $2 more. Cafe Con Leche has a more sit down restaurant feel and better if you want quiet. Cafe Con Leche also has a big banquet hall with dance floor used for live bands and salsa lessons. Great place to drink with big groups or Latin music lovers alike...just be aware the food is second fiddle to the ambiance.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZdzZfaklBEAE,Seattle,en,4877

Some of the sweet potato fries were overcooked, the burger itself had no flavor which was rather odd, and the person that took my order behaved as if he didn't care when I was speaking to him. I appreciate you talking to me about it, but don't walk away when I'm still talking or interrupt me. The gentleman Ian knows a thing or two about service. Unless he's there, I will not come back nor and waste my time trying to support this business.

I'm not planning on coming back unless you all make sure the food is consistently delicious and the service is equally up to par. This is my second time coming here. I'm not sure if the rain is the cause or if you are short staffed or if it is a personal vendetta. There was hardly anyone in there - maybe 6 other people.

Also, the cookie that you sell are also shoddy as well. There's barely any flavor, it is far too thin and crumbly, and the price is egregious!

Did not like raw clams (too fishy for my taste). Cocktails were suburb. They had a lobster and waffle dish which was so unique and good! Lobster was a bit overcooked but the flavor they had def made up for probably a rare mistake (the lobster in lobster roll was not overcooked and melted in mouth).

The service was great - the young man came out and explained the menu and the overall concept.  I did the bulgogi and chicken with a ton of veggies covered with a nice ranch cilantro sauce.

I ordered the red beans and rice and a side of mustard greens.  The beans and rice were smoky and packed full of flavor.  The greens were perfectly seasoned, and the pot liquor..... Oh my lawd!!! SO good!!

Twice is not always nice. Just like the first time we visited the service remains extremely slow from the moment we walked through the door to when we recieved our check and the food is still very poorly done. Brunch came out cold and every egg we orded was very overcooked‚Äîvery overpriced for the quality. Also, the hot sauce only comes in miniature doll house sizes. At least our server was friendly when we could find her. It's embarrassing that the Rail Stop continues to have this problem a year after our first visit.

Stumbled upon D√©j√† Vu while enjoying the French Quarter Festival and what a delightful surprise!

"The burrito with barbacoa is really good. A lot of places put lettuce and sour cream in their burritos, which isn't necessarily all that good in my opinion. Instead, they put rice, beans, onions, cilantro, and your choice of meat.

"BEWARE OF THE SECRET RESERVATION LIST!!

It is very well advertised that this is a ‚Äúno reservations taken‚Äù restaurant. We learned the hard way that you actually CAN make reservations (by emailing the owner directly).

So, when we put our name in for a group of 4 at 6:30 pm and the hostess told us there were only 3 tables ahead of us, we were more than happy to wait as we had been wanting to try this spot for a long time. 2 hours after patiently waiting outdoors (you can‚Äôt wait indoors here), and after watching many groups stroll in to their RESERVED tables, we decided to check in with the hostess. Her advice was that we should have made a reservation by contacting the owner directly.

So, if you find yourself waiting for a table here, just know that the empty table you see through the window may just remain empty until a limo full of people with a secret reservation arrives for their 8:15 reservation.

Easy fix: instead of leading on to your customers that they are the third ones in line for a table, tell them the truth (we have some large parties tonight, special event or request, etc). If we knew the truth, we would have simply returned another night. Alas, our patience did not prevail and we gave up at the 2 hour mark.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENmR2YkNnEAE,Boston,en,1709

"I was visiting New Orleans for a business trip April 15-17. I came across Meals From The Heart on TikTok. I decided to try this restaurant because the reviews on TikTok were good. Upon arrival I met the cashier. Her service was OK. I ordered the crabcake, a small gumbo and a cold pressed orange juice. I was really excited about the food as I haven‚Äôt had any good vegan food since I visited New Orleans. A lot of the restaurants that I wanted to visit were closed or had closed early. I first tried the gumbo and it was OK. I wish that it had more rice, vegetables and mushrooms. I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct way to describe it, but it was very loose and not very thick. The next thing I tried was the crabcake and it was OK. If it were not for the sauce I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been that great. The orange juice however was pretty good. Overall with tip I spent about $40. The crabcake alone was $10. My suggestion is that For $10 you should get two crabcakes and the gumbo should be thicker maybe add some more vegetables, mushrooms and rice I left feeling unsatisfied. I was disappointed with the portion of food I received for the amount of money I spent.

This stuff was junk. I ate 1 small slice and threw it away. Waste of $12.

"I feel taken advantage of, robbed even.

My friend and I went to Tobal√° to have the Valentine prefixe menu. We reserved our table via Resy, and paid a non-refundable deposit of $50 EACH, which they stated would go towards the overall tab at the end of the night.

Our reservation was for 7pm, yet we were seated at a bit after 7:30pm, and did not receive our first course until 8:30. The wait time in-between courses was ridiculous and every dish was more mediocre than the last. The staff was pretty nice whenever they stopped by our table, but that was a rare occurrence in itself.

When it was time to pay, they did not include the $100 we had already put towards the bill until we informed them. And when asked to split the bill in half between two cards, they ended up putting 1/3 on one card and 2/3 of the bill on the other.

I would not come back, and definitely not recommend. I was looking forward to visiting this new addition to the Riverdale area, and really sad that this was the experience we got. Truly baffled.

"I finally got a chance to try this place out after passing by hundreds of times. It's a small space with about 8 tables, The menu is pretty extensive with all of the Mexican favorites you would expect complete with all the various meats you've come to love from Mexican cuisine. I had a hankering for tostadas and My elder came with tinga, which is spicy chicken. Tostadas are dry tortillas loaded with beans lettuce tomatoes maybe peppers, cheese and your choice of meat. The best thing about tostadas is that you have to eat them fresh because they tend to absorb the moisture from the food and can break apart in your hands. You eat them like you would eat a small pizza and I really enjoyed these tostadas. The service was very good and this place has been here a while and does a lot of takeout. It was well worth the wait. Highly recommended!!!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGODhINTJBRRAB,New York,en,4115

The three amigos appetizer which has fresh tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa, and queso was good. The guac could use some salt, and the queso is very thin, but like any other cheese thickened as it cooled. The Tacos and quesadilla were good as well. I had the ""Gaylord Focker"" which taste like the chef went foraging for the ingredients then put them right on the  tortilla. The ""Lookin good Louis"" taco was good as well. My Wife had the ""You're my boy blue"" quesadilla and she liked it as well.

"I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, it was a complete letdown. From start to finish, the service was appalling and left a sour taste in my mouth.

Upon entering, there was no warm welcome or acknowledgment from the staff. We had to wait for what felt like an eternity before anyone bothered to seat us, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.

Once seated, the wait for our orders was excruciatingly long. It took ages for a server to even come to our table to take our drink orders, and when they finally did, they seemed disinterested and unfriendly.

When the food finally arrived, it was subpar at best. The dishes were lukewarm, indicating they had been sitting out for some time before being served. Not to mention, the presentation was sloppy, and it was evident that little care went into preparing our meals.

To make matters worse, when we tried to address our concerns with the manager, they were dismissive and unapologetic. Instead of acknowledging our dissatisfaction, they brushed us off and seemed uninterested in resolving the issues.

Overall, my experience at Shaking Seafood Restaurant was incredibly disappointing. The lackluster service, mediocre food quality, and indifferent management left me feeling frustrated and unlikely to return. Save yourself the hassle and choose a different dining option.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdDVTUnV3RRAB,Boston,en,1303

Staff: They, too, understand how to deliver exceptional customer service.

"Located in the heart of Lakeview, Russell‚Äôs Marina Diner stands as a cherished beacon of New Orleans‚Äô rich culinary tradition.

Since its inception in 1985, this diner has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to destination for exceptional breakfasts, weaving itself into the fabric of the city‚Äôs dining scene.

With a menu that spans the gamut from indulgent fried chicken and waffles to a diverse array of egg specialties, Russell‚Äôs caters to a broad spectrum of tastes.

Not forgetting the health-conscious, the diner also offers lighter fare such as eggwhite omelets and sweet potato pancakes, ensuring that every patron leaves satisfied.

The dining experience is further enhanced by the option to enjoy your meal either inside the diner‚Äôs cozy interior, at the counter where the local vibe thrives, in their inviting dining room, or outside on the pet-friendly patio, making it perfect for every occasion.

During my visit, I decided to try the legendary Egg Saints #33‚Äîa daring concoction that perfectly embodies New Orleans‚Äô flair for culinary innovation.

This dish features a grilled biscuit topped with alligator sausage, grilled tomatoes, poached eggs, and smothered in homemade country gravy.

Each component of the dish harmonizes to create a breakfast experience that is both unique and profoundly satisfying.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with the diner‚Äôs unmistakable local charm, enhanced by the friendly service that made me feel right at home.

The ambiance, a blend of the cozy and the communal, set the perfect stage for what was to be an unforgettable meal.

The Premier League playing softly in the background added a touch of camaraderie, reminiscent of a neighborhood caf√© where everyone is welcome.

The highlight of my visit was, without a doubt, the food.

The Egg Saints #33 was a revelation, transforming the classic eggs Benedict into a dish that captivated my palate and left me pondering the culinary prowess behind it.

Every bite was a testament to Russell‚Äôs commitment to quality and innovation, making it clear why this diner holds a special place in the hearts of New Orleans‚Äô residents and visitors alike.

In a city lauded for its vibrant food scene, claiming the title of ""best breakfast"" is no small feat.

Yet, as I left Russell‚Äôs Marina Diner, I was already yearning to return and dive deeper into their menu.

"Upon meeting the main Manager MITCH.  I was met with
hostility.
There's a severe lack of leadership in this
place. I've been to this place for 20 yrs or more but
it's gone downhill. No lobby open to the public.
The
mgr is confrontational. No teaching, training or
motivating the workers. No ethical practices. No I
won't be supporting this restaurant until there's
changes for the better by hiring general managers
who take care of their employees and give
opportunities to better themselves.

How you can hire someone with a disability and then work them a million hours and because there's a complaint,  And you have a million complaints even before this especially on Yourself, which YOU failed to inquire about from the person it's against, or even TRY to provide additional training, YOU SUCK AS A LEADER! And then to just remove them without even a conversation refusing to answer calls or texts and even a courtesy to let them go.
You are a weak cowardly person who doesn't deserve the title of Manager.
To be hostile and not hear the concerns of the guardian is even worse. You didn't do me a favor by coming over and ""allowing"" me to sit in the locked down lobby.

I'd love to have a conversation with the owner of this place regarding American disability Act!

"Stopped in with the hubby on the way to Maryland from Houston. We wanted to find a local place that was off the beaten path.

We were thoroughly impressed with our meal. I had the fried porkchops with candied yams and potato salad. The porkchops were humongous compared to what I'm used to and they were fried perfectly. The candied yams and mashed potato salad were both addictive.

The hubby had the seafood pasta, fried fish, and jambalaya. The pasta sauce was flavorful, but he was sad there wasn't more crab that was noticeable. However he did love the jambalaya and wished he had gotten a double helping of it instead of a salad.

We had the caesar salad, bacon & french onion soup, I love me some french onion soup and this one was good and their frida cocktail was delicious.

Main issue was the rude waitress. We didn‚Äôt want to judge for no reason, but this lady was just rude. She rolled her eyes at customers, and did not answer to our complaints (she said just leave a bad review). When talking with the manager, the main issue was resolved, but the waitress came up and was rude to the manager as well. She argued back in a disrespectful manner.

"I post a review on Google only for something exceptionally good or exceptionally bad; unfortunately, Saltie Girl was the latter.

I wanted a quick clam chowder lunch before heading home, and Saltie Girl had been mentioned more than once as making a good one. What a disappointment! It was over-thickened, over-salted, under-clammed, and for some odd reason served topped by two fried clams with breading that had already turned soggy.

And speaking of soggy, the French fries were limp as can be. They were listed on the menu as having black garlic and truffle, but truffle flavor (truffle salt?) was all I could taste. I did see some black specs, which I hoped and assumed were some sort of edible item, but otherwise the garlic was absent.

The host was courteous and helpful (this was the only reason I gave two stars instead of one), but the server committed a major faux pas for a higher-end restaurant by not asking, after I ate only half of the chowder and maybe a quarter of the fries, if I was unhappy with the food.

I also ordered a shiso cocktail, which tasted mostly of citrus and sugar, a little bit of gin, and not at all of shiso except for one tired leaf affixed to the glass by an adorable little clothespin.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa3RPdHJ3RRAB,Boston,en,1754

"Having tried thoroughly enjoyed our omakase experiences at Mujo and Hiyakawa we have been trying to find other similar experiences in Atlanta. I am happy to report that Brush's omakase did not disappoint. The service was outstanding. Both the servers and the chef spent generous amounts of time talking with us and making sure we had everything we needed/wanted.

We did the 16 course menu and it was the perfect amount a food and I would say it is a better value when compared to Mujo or Hiyakawa. I would say the atmosphere sits in between those two. Mujo having a very chill comfortable vibe and Hiyakawa being more like a museum and culinary course. At Brush you get a more chill vibe and can get as little or as much information you want to the meal. I would also say that Brush is much less overbearing on the rules than either Mujo and Hiyakawa which was very nice.

The quality of the fish and dishes were amazing. Brush has a unique rice and some unique presentations that the other places don't have. All things considered I think Brush my be the best overall place (accounting for price, comfort and experience).

The only draw back of the omakase experience for me is the the space in not an intimate as the other spots I have mentioned. You can definitely tell you are in Buckhead.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5bWRfU1JnEAE,Atlanta,en,71

It is crispy, the chicken is good quality, and you can actually taste the sesame flavor. The fried rice is always very fluffy and fresh.
My only suggestion would be to add sides of the veggies. Such as a half size of the vegetarian delight or broccoli in brown sauce.

But where is the body of the lobster?  Of the two containers of congee, we did not have even one piece of lobster body.

"Taqueria definition: a Mexican restaurant specializing in tacos.

As a mexican, I felt out of place at this taqueria because it is NOT AUTHENTIC. This is basically a locally owned On the Border / La Frontera Grill. The food isn't the worst but far from flavorful. Even the cashier said, ""Were a boring Taqueria""

My husband hates these types of places because they profit/benefit from the name 'Taqueria' when the flavor/authenticity isn't there. It's cultural appropriation, but I'm sure it's okay since some of the workers were Hispanic, and 1 co-Founder is Mexican. But the main guy is Mike Klank, a white American. It saddens me that Mr. Hernandez has accepted to Americanize our Mexican culture for financial gain. It's altered to fit the demographic they're looking for. The same thing is happening in Mexico. I understand that, but its not right. Its white-washed.

Health inspection was an 86 B.
No onions or cilantro on the tacos.
Tacos are made with flour tortillas, not corn.
No salsa bar.
Enchilada is $4 each, and it looked like vomit. The chicken it had was rotisserie chicken.
Canned beer was $5 each.
Guac was the only decent thing there.

We took the food to go, adding a 5% fee.
We went to El Rey del Taco right after for real Mexican food.

After driving around the store twice and going up to the window, we beeped the car horn and someone finally arrived, staring at us without saying anything. We told the lady that we placed a mobile order on the app and she said we‚Äôre closed. We responded letting her know their hours are until 11 pm and we‚Äôve already paid on the app. She then responds that she can‚Äôt do anything about that. So we‚Äôre out money and drove away hungry. Horrible service, horrible attitudes and I hope that the general manager of this store trains the employees better so they don‚Äôt lose further income.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5c2VfZjVRRRAB,Cary,en,1870

I think my most fundamental critique is that as a result of the pandemic they reinvented themselves as a ‚Äúto go‚Äù restaurant and prioritize that business over in place customers.  As dine in patrons we felt somewhat neglected.  And maybe most importantly, the food deserved better.  The sushi was for the most part top notch.

I will say that some of the tables were not clean when I looked for a place to sit. It wasn't a big deal because there were some clean tables available. I also couldn't find napkins. In other stores there is a place where there are napkins, straws and condiments. I looked around but could not find it here.

I rated this place low unfortunately because of a disrespectful lying manager (Hispanic decent) and her disrespectful co-worker (white lady who thinks she is black). I mentioned their race for a reason. I had a pick up order. Grabbed my food and opened the bag to see if the fries was cold because order was done at 3:00 I walked in at 3:06. While opening the bag the employee was giving me a dirty look so I said I‚Äôm just trying to see if my fries are hot. She then says you good we just put it up there. I continued with checking and just as I thought they were cold. I POLITELY said ma‚Äôam may I please have a fresh order of fries. She rolled her eyes and said they are fresh. I politely said no they are not. She takes the fries I take a seat. The manager comes over and says they can‚Äôt give me fresh fries because the order was fine. I tell the manager I just tasted it and it‚Äôs cold and since I paid for it want them hot. The manger continues to be defiant and disrespectful. I said I‚Äôm not leaving without hot fries. The employee brings new fries (I‚Äôm sure she just redropped but whatever I don‚Äôt care they hot. I ask for DM manger number. They gave a card. I go to the car call the number and the manger who I just got into it with answered. Now this lady lied and assured me it was the right number. All of this was unnecessary and stupid. They only had to give me fresh fries that‚Äôs it. Turned into a real situation and if I wasn‚Äôt smart with self control things could have went left. I‚Äôm still going to file that complaint!

"We live near by this restaurant and decided to have a dinner.
We travel and eat out lots. Also being a Hindu vegetarian can write lots about this place.
This restaurant had many new dishes which we don‚Äôt find in other Indian restaurants in NOLA.
It took real long for our order and the portions were very small. The menu is glorified and all necessary accomplishments not served with appetizers or meals.
We order the Paruppu wada for $10. Two small pieces of hard wada served without any chutney. Please don‚Äôt order this appetizer as it was too dry and no taste at all.
We also ordered the Gobi Manchurian was tiny portion and dry without main ingredients like garlic.
The main reason of our visit was to try the Gutti Vankaya, a fancy name for the eggplant curry.
The peanut based curry was great but eggplants were not cooked to the perfection. Literally we ate curry sauce with rice.

The service was lacking - took a long time to get our initial drinks, forgot to put in our order of oysters so we didn‚Äôt get those until after our entrees, kept pushing us to order as soon as he took our initial drink order, and we asked him if we could change our table‚Äôs TV since it looked like a personal one - he said he would ask, but he never even told us yes or no - I have a feeling he never asked.
The atmosphere was okay. Again, we went hoping we could watch the LSU baseball game since there were a lot of TVs, but we never got an answer if we could change it. The actual seats we sat in though were comfortable.

"Yesterday (Easter Sunday) was the first time ordering from The Yummy Kitchen. I ordered the combination beef & broccoli platter (came with pork fried rice and an egg roll). On the whole, my meal was edible yet underwhelming. My friend ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki with fried rice and two spring rolls. He loves teriyaki but  he's not a fan of their chicken and beef teriyaki. Being first-time patrons of The Yummy Kitchen, we felt blind-sided when the lady on the phone told me AFTER taking our food order that for FIRST-TIME customers they only accept cash or Apple Pay. This was not stated nor specified on their handout menu. On The Yummy Kitchen handout menu we'd received, it listed the credit cards that The Yummy Kitchen accepted: Visa, Mastercard, Discover. We were ready to pay for our meal with a credit card when the lady surprised me with the 'first-time customer/ cash/Apple Pay payment requirement'. We felt that was misleading and not in good faith.

My favorite main dish was the Octopus, which was so soft and not rubbery at all! My favorite vegetable dish was the Spinach. The pine nuts and raisins pair so well with the natural bitterness of the spinach. We ordered 2 desserts, both of which were delicious, but if I had to pick just one to recommend, it‚Äôd be the Flan de Cafe. Everything we ordered (besides the bread) was gluten free, including the chocolate torte (flourless!). Great atmosphere and spectacular service!

"Cafe Flora is an institution in Seattle.  One of the first major vegetrian restaurants in the city.  But it has outgrown its pioneering reputation as it has expanded its footprint with a new restaurant and bakery in SeaTac.

Our party of five waited 20 minutes for a table.  Then we waited another 30 minutes before anyone took our order, then once we gave the order we waited another 20 minutes for our food.  Meanwhile our teenage daughter was desperately hungry. When my wife went to the wait staff inquiring when our food would be staff, a waitress said she would ""check.""

Once the food arrived it was ordinary.  Well and beautifully plated.  But it was generally bland and boring.

I don't blame the wait staff.  Clearly management of the restaurant has left it understaffed.  Our waitress was taking care of 15 tables in our room and disappeared for long periods. Perhaps serving even more tables elsewhere.  A totally unpleasant experience.  Oh and did I say it was my wife's birthday??  What a downer.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPXzhURFJREAE,Seattle,en,4852

Desert was the chocolate chip cookie that was just OK. We will try this place again when we are in town.

"The record store is a one-of-a-kind and deserves 5 stars!
Cafe review only - The restaurant menu provides many different variations of egg, sausage, vegetable, and potato dishes. We anticipated the quality of the cafe food to be similar to a IHOP, and we found it met that level of American-style breakfast dishes. The welcoming staff were friendly and offered to come find us when a table was ready so that we could peruse the record store in search of artistic gems. The combination of the record store and cafe is an excellent idea, however, a little more attention to the quality of a few select dishes, rather than offering a long listed of similar dishes, would help to elevate the status of the cafe among local foodies. Being from out-of-state, we were pleasantly surprised to find the local farmers' market right outside of Easy Street Records & Cafe, making that an enjoy morning experience overall on a Sunday morning.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNHNyLWF3EAE,Seattle,en,4881

"I‚Äôve been here for lunch and dinner. Google restricts my review to one meal (at least for photos and menu items) but I‚Äôd love to share my experiences of both.

My latest visit was for lunch. This is one of the most underrated lunch experiences in Atlanta. The atmosphere is light, airy, casual but elevated/sophisticated. Menu seems unassuming but has some absolute knockouts. Service was also just really enjoyable; I‚Äôm not much of a conversationalist but had Caroline at the bar and ended up having one of the best restaurant chats in recent memory, and was guided through the menu for an awesome selection of the omelette, sticky toffee pudding, and coffee.

Dinners are more intimate, and a little hard to get a reservation so it‚Äôs been tough for my schedule. Unsure how a group reservation would go but can vouch for solo trips and dates, or close 1:1 catch ups. Despite the reservation struggles, I appreciate the smaller seating capacity and streamlined menu. I suppose I‚Äôd like more small bite options to pair with the wine because I always end up getting the Jam√≥n Ib√©rico and would like more meats, but that‚Äôs knit pick.

I‚Äôll end with a confirmation that the book store element is not a gimmick and not aesthetics only - the curation is so well done. I‚Äôve gotten 5 books as gifts and 2 for myself.

I don‚Äôt know what magic he put in the beans but like I use it as like a sauce over the rice and dipped it in the chicken and I‚Äôm telling you, I have not had a lunch like this for $11 ever before in my life.

My husband is a black man who was wearing jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt.  We order pickup through Grubhub a lot as we don't dine-in due to my husband's health issues. This woman made a judgment upon sight and tried to refuse someone a meal they paid for.

"I love this place. I like that you can choose your own lettuce, veggies and meat and that they only use mozzarella cheese as opposed to the sharp cheddar. I love watching as they chopt up all the ingredients in a bowl. They have a variety of dressings for your salad. If you are a ranch or caeser like me, they have it. If you are more of an oil-based like your vinaigrette there are plenty of options. Even honey mustard and other flavors. The food is fresh and they always have on gloves. It's worth the money. I like that they get you through the line fast and there is eating area inside. A little tight but it works. Never can go wrong with a salad.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMFoydEx3EAE,Charlotte,en,2349
"Service was less than helpful as we stopped to get a friend something to eat. Burger was not dressed nor had lettuce onions tomatoes or pickles. Although Wendy's sponsored across the US 5 for $5 was nearly $7 at this location. Used the drive through. The person taking our order was less than helpful which pretty much describes the service, filing the order as shown on the order board, and the over cooked burger which was not stacked burger on burger Dave's Daily Double but a plain dbl burger half in & out of crushed bun & chicken nuggets & under cooked fries.

I suggest avoiding this particular food that provides poor service, overcharged for nationally sponsored meal deals, & substandard food products. As an employee who lives in the same condo complex I do says she would never ever eat there as they suck! I think that pretty much explains our experience at this location.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNObUlYQi1nRRAB,New Orleans,en,6505
"I have been coming here for almost a year now and never had a bad experience. First off, it's affordable, they have plenty of salad options and if you don't care for them, customize one. I love their lemonades, especially that frozen strawberry,  the staff are great, and their quick. Today I tried the steak and fajita salad and blueberry Basil lemonade. I didn't care for the dressing,  but I do enjoy their balsamic vinaigrette on their autumn roasted salad,  sooo good. Their portions are definitely more worth it for the price you pay, unlike these other restaurants. Also, try the soups, you won't be disappointed.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEd0pDU0tnEAE,Dallas,en,3752

"I was so excited about eating at Dooky Chase. I had seen Mrs. Chase on the food channel before Covid. We finally made it to New Orleans.  The night before going to Dooky Chase I googled the restaurant. I read up on the history, dress code and hours. It never said you had to make a reservation. We struggled to find a Uber. I was so excited!!  We get to Dooky Chase and the lady asked me what did I want. I thought she was joking but she wasn‚Äôt. I told her we came to eat. Why else would we be there. She was so rude. Told us we needed a reservation and told us we could come back in two hours. The front area had a whole bunch of empty tables. We traveled from AR to try their gumbo.

The workers blatantly ignored me as I was standing at the window. I was literally standing there for more than 15 mins before I got any help. Then they were rude and had an attitude. The food was good but I was really uncomfortable just standing out especially when there were so many homeless people near the store trying to talk to me and ask for money from me.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwNk5HVFZnEAE,Atlanta,en,896
"We walked in and sat at the bar because we were told the earliest seat we could get was over 1.5hr wait. It‚Äôs a Thurs night and we had no reservation so that‚Äôs not unusual- sign of a good restaurant, right?

At no point while we were there (almost til 8) did the restaurant even approach 2/3 full. Maybe a bunch of no shows? Or maybe it‚Äôs because the food just wasn‚Äôt good.

We started with the Provola sausage appetizer that was OK, but tasted kind of lemony - maybe the oregano was just way too heavy? But the sausage definitely didn‚Äôt stand out.

Then, after over a 25 min wait including us promoting the bartender to check, I had spaghetti fra diavolo. I expect a little spice in fra diavolo, but it was pure black pepper that I tasted. No tomato, chili, basil or lemon. The shrimp were rubbery to boot. Did not finish. And we had paesano potatoes. The Parmesan was past the point of melting to nearly burnt on, there was no rosemary or garlic flavor. It didn‚Äôt even taste like it had salt or pepper (maybe they ran out after the spaghetti‚Ä¶).

And to top it off, the service was not good. We had to prompt them to check for our food after we had been sitting for 25 min. Generally when sitting at the bar, the bartender will check on your drinks to see if you like them - esp when one has an empty cocktail glass. Not tonight at Gianna.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEd2VyS0t3EAE,New Orleans,en,6092

The crab was EXQUISITE. Who knew sea urchin custard would actually be good? The scallop was cooked to perfection, the duck was the perfect cut, and the passionfruit and chocolate combo was to die for. The small bites in between were amazing too- wonderful breads and the best corn dogs you could ask for! The service was amazing as well. Our fabulous server Casey explained everything in great detail and made sure we were well taken care of. The presentation of food and drink as well as the clearing of plates were so smooth and clearly well practiced. Each staff member I interacted with was full of knowledge and so amazing helping! Megan made the best hot chocolates, Carlos followed up with perfectly foamed and decorated lattes. Kacy, Rachel, Lizzie, Mari, Josie, Mike, and Tim were fantastic about clearing exactly on time and so incredibly kind in my brief interactions with them. Kalyn was a fantastic hostess and so incredibly accommodating. Another fantastic part of the evening was meeting the wonderful Chef Spencer! He and all of the other kitchen staff put SO much care and effort into making our dishes wonderful. The atmosphere was very cozy with lovely music playing just quiet enough for conversation but just loud enough to set an uplifting mood. I‚Äôm sure there are many other names I forgot to get, but truly the experience was wonderful and one I will never forget. Thank you to the amazing Heron‚Äôs staff for making my birthday so special!
