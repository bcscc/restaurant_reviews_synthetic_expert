Ordered the Couyon Daddy and it was very flavourful, honestly could have shared this one with someone , portion was great. My friend ordered the Mushroom Soft Scramble and the potatoes were seasoned so well , I crave for it.

Service is a bit odd, our server was amazing but when food came around it seemed like any staff at the restaurant could grab it and almost dump it on the table. Bit of an odd contrast.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMHF6V09nEAE,New Orleans,en,5465

"I’ve ordered our Chinese new year dinners from this restaurant for years and our friends and family rave about the food. The restaurant is family run and super friendly. I highly recommend the beef chow fun, whole steamed sea bass with ginger and scallion, Peking duck, dry braised string beans, mu shu chicken. They also have a sticky rice stuffed chicken dish that is famous (on my list to try). Order the steamed sea bass and sticky rice stuffed chicken dish 24 hours in advance.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkaEt5Sm13RRAB,San Francisco,en,4570

"I happened upon Pluck by chance while looking to book myself a Singles Awareness Day dinner while I was on vacation. It sounded intriguing, so I took a chance. I was not disappointed! The food was amazing, from appetizers to entrees to dessert. But the real show stopper is the bottled wine list. Well, really hard to call a small novela a ""list."" Pretty much anything you could want in terms of variety was there, with recommendations from the staff. I also have to mention the atmosphere...great decor with a pretty great playlist for background. Next time I visit New Orleans, I'll be back!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkbHRQTnVnRRAB,New Orleans,en,5580

We went to a nice area. We greeted by Andrew, he was very nice and made sure we were taken care of. Our server was Brittney, what an excellent server and so-so nice. Brittney made sure all was perfect.  Ask for Brittney. Good luck to you Brittney.   Our souffle potatoes OMG! Filet mignon cooked perfectly.  The cauliflower a little undercooked. All went well.  Will come back for sure.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeGFpbWFREAE,New Orleans,en,6058
Why didn't anyone tell me we had a Korean fried chicken spot in Fort Worth? I came here for lunch to check it out and they had so many options.

"I ordered pizza from this company all the time and today I received my pizza. The pizza was burnt, taste like a burnt pizza and absolutely hard as a rock felt like a paper weight. I called at 8:17pm on 10/22 to let them know and person I spoke to was absolutely condescending and rude. Explain to me that I was wrong and this is how it is made. I reiterated that I order all the time and this is not how their pizza taste. It taste like burnt cardboard. He then says this is how we make it and hangs up phone. I will never order again just off customer service. If they acknowledged their mistake and even offered to remake then I wouldn’t be writing this review and would continue to be a loyal customer.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1NnB1TnFnRRAB,Washington,en,4896
"Dined in on 4/30/2022.

The food was decent, but they DON'T offer tap water. How do you charge $2 for bottled water in Flushing? Unacceptable.

A group of diners sitting to our right ordered bottled waters halfway during their meal because their throats were parched. The family sitting in front of us left several disposable plastic cups and opened bottled waters. All the diners there were pushed to order bottled water. How do you finish the meal otherwise?",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkb3JYTTZ3RRAB,New York,en,4313

"I really dislike patronizing my own people establishments. OMG. It took 20 minutes for someone to come and take my order. Then when she did, she didn't write it down and of course my order was incorrect. Cmon people get it right. Then you wonder why we have negativity towards us. Just get it right it's not that hard. Lastly my darn chicken came out so dark because if old bad grease and it tasted that way that I couldn't eat it.

"The lady who picks up the phone in the morning has a disgusting attitude, doesn’t let you finish a sentence and immediately dismisses what you have to say. If you hate your job, don’t work there, simple, but she had an attitude as soon as she picked up the phone, if I call a restaurant I am PAYING for food, I expect to be received with a welcoming tone, especially at 8am in the morning.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dzd5ZVBREAE,New York,en,4189
"I've been obsessed with Planta ever since my first visit but this location surprised me in all the wrong ways. It's different than all the other Planta locations in that the customer service is garbage. They treat you like it's a burden for them to serve you. They asked us where we would like to sit and we chose outside seating. 10, 15, 20 minutes go by and no server comes to get our orders (restaurant was not busy and severs were inside chatting). Almost half an hour later a lady comes out to tell us that ""the servers don't want to come outside bc they've pollen allergies""... after finishing our lunch inside we come out only to find out that there are multiple parties sitting outside and getting served, even have a photo as a proof. The same server who denied to come outside to serve us was the one serving others when we left. I've never been treated so badly at any restaurant let alone a Planta. The bathroom had a weird smell and wasn’t clean. Management seemed whack as we had multiple different servers serving and randomly coming to our table. Mainly, it felt like we didn’t belong there and felt like we were facing racism. I am so so unhappy and disappointed.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqLXAzZmRREAE,Atlanta,en,321

Wonderful little restaurant and bar in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The oysters were so big and fresh I had to cut them in 1/2 to fit on a cracker! True story!

"Seriously good chicken! We tried fried chicken, poutine with chicken, and the cauliflower; all are a must!  Some of the best fried chicken you may ever have in your life. The seasonings added onto the chicken makes this a flavor bomb and different from all others. Juicy all the way through too!

Superb service and a fun atmosphere.

Very limited seating. We got lucky and showed up early during a weekday and got last open table.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNmZuRGRBEAE,Washington,en,5335

their side orders are overpriced. The cost is the same as an actual plate of food. 26.29 for 2 sides (fried pork & smothered veggies no meat) ridiculous.

"Alright, my expectations are pretty low because I’m grabbing a meal in a busy airport. BUT! I was pleasantly surprised by Urban Olive.

1. Super fast - like they had my meal out in seconds and it was fresh off the grill.
2. So friendly. Actually. I’ve never had a friendly experience at an airport restaurant. Kudos to the staff.
3. Relatively healthy. It’s nice to have veggies and protein to fill up on before a long flight.
4. Surprisingly affordable. I would have expected to pay this for a quick-serve restaurant in the real world, and I didn’t feel price gouged.
5. The renovations in Terminal 5 are fresh and modern (finally) and make it a nice atmosphere for people watching and relaxing for a few minutes during a travel day.

All in all, pleased ",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROaHRtMnRnRRAB,Chicago,en,2837

Also had their empanadas which were stuffed to the max and perfectly fried. I didn't try it but I love their idea of rice bowls for a Domincan spot.

"This restaurant is definitely overhyped in New Orleans. Securing a reservation can be tough, which might give you the impression that everyone is clamoring to dine at Galatoire's. They enforce a formal dress code, and if you arrive without a jacket, they'll provide you with one if you want to sit in the main dining area. You'll quickly notice that the clientele tends to be on the older side.
Once you're seated and handed the menu, the waiters are quite focused on upselling you on various items. We opted for a crab salad to start, and honestly, it was presented in the most disappointing manner I've ever seen from a high-end restaurant. Our main courses, shrimp creole and crab sardou with spinach and artichoke, also lacked in presentation. While the taste was decent, it fell short of gourmet standards, especially given the price.
Service wasn't particularly efficient either; we observed waiters wandering around aimlessly. I'm not trying to criticize the place unfairly, but I truly don't believe it deserves to be ranked among the city's top restaurants. If you adjust your expectations accordingly, you may be able to avoid disappointment.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeDZuWWFBEAE,New Orleans,en,6054
"Super disappointed. We, a party of 2, had a brunch reservation for 12pm today. We checked in a little early, and the hostess let us know the kitchen was running behind by 40 minutes and that the wait would not be longer than 40 minutes. We said no problem, we’ll wait at the bar. Checked in at the 45 minute mark and table was not ready. It’s now almost an hour and a half later and our table is still not ready. We left 30 minutes ago.

This seems like a perpetual issue based on reviews so would love to see management make some changes. We’ll try again another day, and will update my review then.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREOHZxQkd3EAE,Dallas,en,3249

"We arrived at the restaurant 40 minutes earlier than our reservation, there were many tables available. The young female host(Andrea Tejeda) said we would have to wait until our reservation time, which was totally fine. But then, I noticed three parties who had reservations after ours being seated by this young female host, even the walked in customers were seated. I went to ask her, but she just continued talking to the people who had just come in and ignored me. Finally, I managed to ask her if our table was ready. She said I had to wait until our reservation time was up, and she continued leading the customers in without having them wait for their reservation time is up. By the time of our reservation, she still hadn't called us. At the same time, a party with a reservation 20 minutes later to our reservation arrived, which is not even their time yet! and she led them to a table immediately. How incredible and ridiculous is this?! If my family hadn't been very tired, we would've gone to another place that knows how to serve its customers.

Very simple but to the point menu.

This particular day Michael was the bartender, from start to finish the service was terrible. I'm unsure why, but he had the worst attitude. He was very cold & short, as if we did something to him by simply existing. He even threw my check down on the bar after I decided to take my food to go due to the things I was experiening.

I had chicken burrito here 2 years ago and it tasted delicious but I regretted it afterwards. The costumer service is alright they interact with costumers and they give sauce and takeout containers if you ask. They forgot to give me napkins though .
I would eat here again to try other stuff in the menu but I would come often if they improved .

Each item I have ordered has blown my socks off.

The indoor seating space is a little small, but there is also outdoor seating.

I got up and explained one of the female servers what happened. I told her to go and see for herself the table where I was sitting. I pointed to the dirt and dust particles on the table. We both ran our hands and fingers on the table. She was unfazed & unconcerned about the mishap and condition. Her only response was ""we don't have that here."" I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor and was told there was none available. I asked for a business card and I was told they had none. I asked for their phone number so I can speak to some responsible person and I was told that she did not know it. I was rudely told to Google the information if I wanted the phone number. No professionalism, care or concern was ever shown, demonstrated or exhibited by anyone there. This is a health and safety issue & concern that this establishment failed considerably not only to mediate but failed to apologize for and failed to satisfactory addressed.

"Nestled in the heart of Petworth on Upshur, San Matteo, is a delightful Italian restaurant that exceeded all expectations. The wife and I have walked by here for a while and finally found time to do an impromptu date night. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with warm smiles and a cozy atmosphere that set the stage for a memorable dining experience. The attentive wait staff made us feel right at home, offering recommendations and ensuring that every detail of our meal was perfect. Unfortunately I didn’t the waitress’s name, but she was so nice!

The menu boasted a variety of classic Italian dishes, and we opted for the funghi pasta and bolognese, both of which were bursting with flavor and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The house red wine complemented our meal beautifully, and we couldn't resist indulging in the decadent tiramisu for dessert. I do have to warn you…their bread is dangerous. It’s so addictive and fluffy. I couldn’t stop eating it.

San Matteo is a must-visit for anyone craving some great Italian food in a cozy local family vibe. We really hope they take off and more people frequent this spot.

Tonight I ordered a too good to go last minute. Work finished late so I was starving. But it was 10 minutes before they closed. I called to make sure they would have at least one order left before telling them I will be there in the next couple minutes.
When I got there the door was locked and they told me somebody else picked up the toogood order. I wasn’t even mad, just disappointed. But Ritchie was kind enough to offer to make me a sandwich.
I told him I would take anything.

Here I am eating one of the best chicken cutlets ever. Tomato, lettuce, onion bacon and an aoli sauce. But the secret ingredient is love. This will be my to go spot from now on.

This is almost 2024, I want the convenience of ordering online. If I can't do that, I am simply going to order from somewhere else from now on.

I don't understand why he couldn't have just explained to me how to order it correctly next time instead of picking a fight with me.

The day previous to this review I went and got the Caniac to go and when I got to work it was short 2 pieces of chicken. Called and they immediately said come back and we'll make it right. Now the reason I decided to make the review is due to the manager who stepped in when I got there today. Some managers and fast food establishments like to stand around and make themselves look important at times. Jy however evidently is more concerned about customer service and correcting errors that his team caused. He didn't just say make the food for me he did it himself to make sure it was done right. That's some pretty good customer service and a way to step up to show how important customer service should be to everybody. Good job sir!,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkZ3JfaU13EAE,Dallas,en,3787

"I was looking for a place nearby for sushi, and I found this place, which is very close. I tried it out, and it was delicious. Quick service. Tonight 12/24/19 I stopped by for a sushi dinner and shrimp shumai. When I got home I had sashimi, with brown rice in a plastic container. The shumai was the only thing they got right. Partially my fault for not checking it first. I have changed from 5 to two stars. Gave them one more try. That's the last picture I posted. That eel at the bottom of the photo. It was rubbery, very rubbery. I'm pretty sure it also has to do with the location. You're probably going to find quality sushi at a place you're spending top dollar. I will not choose Saki II next time. Or just take a train ride to 51st in Manhattan to Nippori. I need to add that even though their sushi is not up to standards, I have never tried anything from their cooked menu. Good luck 5/14/22 I have to commend you on your latest maki and sushi, because it was very flavorful and fresh, but hold on and take a close look at the fake lobster that came in your seafood delight. Unbelievable! Do you really think that passes for lobster? I thought that I would give the cooked menu a try and you shock me with this! Nobody's perfect but trying to pass this as lobster is ridiculous!!!! Well.....if you walk up to the Grand Concourse and cross the street and make a left you're going to Muzi Japanese Restaurant. 2831 Grand Concourse.

Customer service would be awesome if not for the lies of the menu. After waiting in the parking lot to get my order and open it,, it LOOKED like amazing CATFISH. They even gave the wife an extra fillet. Started to eat only to find out that it was SWAI and not CATFISH. Swai is a cheap disease carrying fish from china. It is not CATFISH. We ended up going to Ronnie J on St. Augustine in the grove. My wife now has food poisoning and is sick the next day. Seems like most of DFW is doing this. Be careful with CASH ONLY places.

Con:
1. 5.5$ per taco.
2. These are small size street tacos.

4. The sauces are interesting

"The shrimp and grits here is amazing. The cheesy jalapeno grits made the dish with flavourful shrimp and sauce atop. The bone marrow was a bit disappointing in flavours. It needs some seasoning and refinement. My partner got the Bouillabaisse which looked great but we feel the dish needs rice instead of bread to really get that sauce. To end, we got the bread pudding which was delicious. I wish I stopped the waiter before he poured the entire serving of caramel sauce on top as I tend to prefer my desserts less sweet. Nonetheless it was great and the added pecans was a nice touch. I also tried the blackberry cocktail which was disappointing. The cocktail tasted alright but it was not cold enough and clearly had not been chilled or shaken with ice. I would skip the cocktails here. Service was friendly and attentive.

"Went for dinner on a Monday night with coworkers, we’re all also staying at the hotel. Reservation at 7:15, sat around 7:20. No one came by the table to even take appetizer orders for at least 20 minutes. A guy eventually came over with bread in that 20 mins and we asked him for our server.

I speak for the whole table when I say the overall service was subpar for the price, we each spent $50-100 to only have water filled once, if that, and a hefty wait in between ordering, receiving food, and checks. My check was also incorrect which ended up costing an extra 15 mins to fix that. Food was ok, but it’s not worth the languishing service attitude and several mistakes on the orders.

All in all, we were out a little after 9 and exhausted as we have to work each day starting at 6am. Likely won’t be back unless it’s room service or bar food.

Edit: I genuinely didn’t expect this review to carry any weight in the world at all, not even in the slightest. I assumed it would get lost within all reviews never to be seen again. But within hours of me posting the hotel set out to make it right which is crazy. Also, I didn’t realize the hotel is so involved with the restaurant or even cared what went on in it!

This is an all you can eat breakfast buffet. It is expensive but conveniently located within the Hyatt Hotel. The customer service was outstanding. Our waitress provided outstanding customer service. There were plenty of options to choose from. The food was delicious. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because the omelette and waffle station was horrible. I did not get the omelette and waffle I ordered the first time and had to complete a second card. I waited over 30 minutes before getting the omelette and waffle that I ordered.

"With a name like Sneaky Pickle, we thought the menu would be full of pickle plates. We were wrong, but it's still worth visiting. It's more than worth visiting. It's among the best food we had while spending six days in New Orleans. Dining around 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday in April, here's our experience.

1) Food: Everything we ate was delicious starting with the oysters and ending with the wagyu burger, which my seven-year-old daughter enjoyed too. The sunchokes are unique and worth ordering. My mother-in-law loved the squid ink pasta and my wife really enjoyed the buffalo tofu lettuce wraps (what they are known for).

2) Drink: Their menu includes cocktails, beer, wine, and more. I ordered a rainbow sherbet sour ale. My wife liked their brine drink for a savory option.

3) Service: From the hostess to the server, everyone was kind, efficient, and welcoming. Our food was perfectly timed.

4) Space: It's beautiful with a large indoor dining room and a bar. There are two unisex restrooms in the back near the stairs to the second level, which I assumed was for staff only.

5) Area: We found free street parking nearby. Located inside Bywater, it's a great neighborhood to walk around after dinner, finding little houses and parks. For dessert, we walked to nearby Big O's Original Popsicle Doorbell.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaE5qM2N3EAE,New Orleans,en,5464

"We were staying at the Wyndam Hotel (April 4,5,6,7,8), and it is literally around the corner! We asked the front desk staff and two of them said Mena's (in unison?!?!?!).  200 St Chartres.  Ok, so they liked Mena's. We also asked a pedicab driver - again Mena!  So, we tried it. So glad we found it early in our vacation. We were there for all breakfasts from then on. Great food, great employees - felt like home. Unfortunately, we didn't discover their lunch menu until the last day (try the muffaletta - I wanted to take some home!) It was so soft and flavorful.  Lots of options too.  While it didn't affect us - they have a bar, too!
The servers were very positive and friendly! The two we used (and enjoyed) were Dymond and Jamayra. Mena only does breakfast/lunch and that is fine. However, we would have lived there if they did dinner too!

"If I could give it 10 negative stars I would, they have the worst customer service, I ordered by seamless a main course, an order of rice and a dessert, at 11:00 PM It is supposed that if you do not have all the items you just call the customer and let them know, so the customer decides if they want to change the order or cancel the order. However, the woman behind the counter decided that it was a very good idea to only send me a portion of white rice and the dessert, without telling me she canceled the item on line. So I called very upset to ask why they didn't call me to let me know, maybe I’d have can change the main course, because logically I was waiting for it, to which she cheekily and sarcastically said: yes my love, I should have called you, but I didn't, I'm sorry, and we closed, we don’t have more delivery service for today. 🤬 The order was $30 so I added $6 tip, but when they canceled the item, the order price changed to $10 but the tip continued being $6 still, that means I payed more than 50% tip and all because of this woman's “audacity”. could you imagine how annoying this would be if your bill has some zeros more?

"I tried this place on Monday and had the best experience - my call was answered and I was even greeted by the owner upon arrival and the jerk salmon bowl was so fresh and delicious! However, since then I’ve been unable to speak with anyone to place a order.

Today since my calls weren’t being answered, I placed a order through Grubhub at 7:40. When I arrived to pick up my order at 7:50 I was told that the kitchen closes at 7:30. If that is the case, why are your operating hours until 8. Maybe to avoid confusion update your hours to reflect when your kitchen closes.

I called several times to avoid this. Very disappointed!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtbmYzZXhnRRAB,Dallas,en,3304

"This was my favorite Italian place in East Boston ‘till tonight, I’ve tried most of the items in the menu, but I am a sea food pasta man so I loved here at Rino’s the calamari with home made linguine pasta. Tonight was really bad, I rarely send dishes back, but tonight the plate was inedible, way too salty and way too overheated so I send it back with the waitress, whom I ve known from the times I’ve been there and she is very nice and friendly so she was so nice to take my plate to had it made again… what a disappointment it was pretty much the same… so only because I was very hungry I ate only the calamari which had no much flavor and left all the badly cooked salty pasta, I wonder if they had changed cook, because even the presentation of te plate and the quality of the calamari was so different from previous times. The white sauce dish in this picture is how it used yo be made, it was delicious.

Long story short we ordered food that came with two sides they were out of one so it was substituted for mac n cheese our Mac and cheese along with the appetizer came far after our fish and chicken came leaving us to eat appetizer and sides without the meat. Instead of compensating for food coming out at different times, putting sauce on chicken when asked to put it on the side, appetizer coming at the end they decided to charge us an up charge for Mac n cheese even though meal came with two sides one of which they were out of. Never told there was an up charge and stated we should have just got double greens. Excuse me!!! Never again. And don’t get me started on the  rookie cop they have in there.

I'd recommend the Tomato Beef Chow Mein, which is basically how I judge Chinese restaurants in SF (it's historically an SF Chinese-American specialty). You can request thin crispy pan fried noodles for it too, which is my favorite variation. We also really loved the orange chicken, very tasty.

"Generally speaking, I was disappointed in the service. Took about 8 minutes to be greeted after I sat at the bar and my bartender was not particularly thrilled to be working it seemed. She was attentive, but I had stared at the menu for 5 minutes and prepared to order before she told me what I wanted wasn't available. Apparently all items in the entree section weren't available. A simple 'these items aren't available right now' while handing me a menu would have sufficed. Food that I ordered (chicken club) was very obviously just sliced deli chicken with cheap fries. Shouldn't be $12 let alone $20. Hubbard Inn has better value at this location imo.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5elByUkh3EAE,Chicago,en,2768

"I visited Grill and Vine at the Westin Downtown Dallas and had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The food and menu items were subpar, my server didn’t know in-depth about any items on the menu, but those things were not a big deal. When my check comes for $220, I give my card and the server comes back saying that only $160 was deducted and that I still owe the additional $60. So I check my account, things are all good so I give back my card to charge the rest. They then charge me an additional $180 and are saying I still owe more money. Seeing that I’ve already been charged $340 for a $220 bill I immediately go to the manager bc it makes no sense whatsoever. The manager proceeds to tell me that the card reader automatically charged the amount of $180 and he doesn’t know why. In what world does a card reader charge random amounts? You would have to type in the amount owed to be charged.

While trying to see what’s going on and get my money back, Louis Almassy comes over and immediately tells me to calm down, calls me aggressive, and threatens to call the authorities on me without even knowing what’s going on or why I’m upset about being overcharged. He continued to call me aggressive and threatened to call the cops on me all for being upset about money being taken from me. I didn’t appreciate being called names and being threatened with cops for simply just calling out being overcharged.

I truly believe that I was only threatened with the cops being called because I’m black as there was nothing happening that warranted a cop being involved when again, money was taken from ME. Louis saw a black man upset and immediately pegged me as the problem without even getting an understanding of the situation. Even after getting an understanding, he never apologized for threatening to call the cops.

Furthermore, Louis is a loss prevention manager which “protects a company's assets from fraud and theft”, why would I be reprimanded by him when I’m the one in need of help? This dining experience was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkZ2Fqcll3EAE,Dallas,en,3202

The Cajun Fries were some of the best we’ve had and the garlic noodles pair well with this hearty meal.

Depending on your spending tier, you get free food. We got a free lobster!

Carrot cake was very moist and tasty. The red velvet was okay, the frosting was creamy, but the cake was lacking moistness and was a little dry. Definitely opt for the carrot cake!

"We drove all the way from Queens, , the way the restaurant looks, in the middle of nowhere, closed to a golf country club.

My mother who had been here before, had recommended this place and we decided to eat in, at first the waiter seems to have a attitude🤬 look like (he) the waiter, a older man appear to be bother when asked questions about the menu🤨, I had to intervene and try not to spoil our mood🤠 the place was not full had plenty of empty tables, anyways the waiter should remember not everyone is familiar with Mexican food or dish, and not everyone is from the local area but other staff members who waited on us the young man's and woman made it a more pleasant experience🤫.

We had the avocado nachos salad that was made on site🤔, The enchiladas and steak was very good and the drinks frozen 2 margaritas mango & strawberry 🥰🪅, a small bottle of coke and 1 mojito 🤫 were definitely good, my little boy had apple juice with a small side other so for 3 adults and one child the bill was over $200+ 

I was a little surprised but again for the first time being in this restaurant and the area it wasn't bad except the over price $$$.

I would visit again if the price is right🤫🤔 just make sure you know what your ordering and the drinks, I been to other (Latin American) &  Mexican restaurants like in upper Manhattan and the prices are reasonable, the amount of food very satisfying , in other words I can feed 3people + 1 child comfortably with the same type of menu without breaking the bank.

So the service ( Waiter) was ok,  food was good, the drinks was great, The price mmmmm 🤔 pricey, the restaurant is very unique and beautiful environment probably will visit again.🤔",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5X3NiSjh3RRAB,New York,en,4216

The food itself is pretty good and I'd say pretty authentic as a northern Chinese restaurant. The food is meant to be eaten dine in tho because the taste changes a lot after it sits in the delivery for a minute. The staff is overall friendly but the restaurant itself felt a bit like a warehouse. You essentially eat alone and for me it makes the vibes off and they got boxes everywhere on the service counter for some reason.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMnJMYXNBRRAB,San Francisco,en,4707

This restaurant has PLENTY of wait staff, they are all just condescending, rude, and make you wait on yourself. Service on a Saturday at 3pm was abysmal despite a plethora of servers. We were made to feel like a burden for simply existing in the restaurant even though we were nothing but polite and undemanding. Portions were horrendously small for the price, though I do have to say the food itself was tasty. They’ve sadly let their instagram fame go to their head and no longer care about creating repeat customers once you are inside their doors.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREM09ybm53RRAB,Boston,en,1759

I want to go back to New Orleans so I can eat here again. They have a separate vegan menu that has so many great choices-including beignets! So hard to find vegan beignets so I was SO happy to have found this place. Everything was delicious. My husband ordered from the regular menu and he enjoyed his meal as well. The people who run it are great. New Orleans can be a very challenging place for vegans. Many of the restaurants we looked into had zero vegan options (which I find incredibly sad).

"Stopped in for a lunch with my sister and cousin. Great service. The large window to the patio was open but it was a little chilly out so we sat next to it. Highlights were the bread, margherita pizza and branzino. Zucchini chips had potential but were overly salted. Caesar salad was the biggest let down. The dressing was sweet 🧐 maybe due to the Mayo used. It was weird.

The next delightful/delicious moment was the joy of eating my delicious pizza and salad. The pizza always has generous toppings and I love the crust. It's perfection! Salvio's house salad is also not what most restaurants offer as a ""house"" salad. Their house salad is packed with tomatoes, banana peppers, black olives, onions etc. Salvio's always takes their food to the next level of deliciousness.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENFo2VU9nEAE,Cary,en,2225

"Was very underwhelmed by my experience, got a classic burger with fries, as well as tried options from the salad bar.

Obviously the most basic menu item, but the burger really left a lot to be desired, the meat tasted bland, dry, and overcooked, and the massive dry bun did it no favors. Hopefully the more complex menu items are better, because this was underwhelming for sure.

The salad bar ended up being pretty overpriced, I wanted to try their various pasta salads but with the weight price it ended up being $9 for a pretty small amount of food. I’m assuming this price is meant for customers to take the hot protein items like chicken tenders rather than just salads, but I found it too expensive.

Also there was no napkins available at the self service area for utensils as far as I could tell and that was awkward.

I’ll consider coming back but for $20 I really didn’t feel like the meal was worth it.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNFotTkFnEAE,San Francisco,en,4600

"Our server was great so let’s lead with that. The food itself was very mediocre. I’ve eaten lots of plant based food and this was all one note. Muted flavor. No pizaz or real flavor. Just spicy mayo. Had the broccoli, Japanese sweet potatoes, Korean monthly special roll, mushroom hand roll, spicy tuna roll, and a few others. It all tasted the same sub par at best. Small portions that lacked big flavor is so disappointing. Yes I’ve been to a Planta before and that’s what’s so shocking.

The chairs were so uncomfortable.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMnV1Y0JnEAE,Atlanta,en,322

"The most horrible customer service you could ever imagine. I’ve ordered from here once before and ordered the vegetable chow fun which was decent. I specified that I want the thin noodles and was told that’s what chow fun is, is Angel noodles. This time I came in to get the same thing and received these flat looking noodles which is completely different from the chow fun I’m use to. I didn’t think to specify because the last time I was made to feel stupid for specifying the type of noodles. So I called to let him know and all he could say was “I don’t know what to tell you”. To add insult to injury this is by far the most disgusting dish I have ever tasted. It tastes like slop. I would advise to go somewhere else where the atmosphere is welcoming and clean.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEeWJXVUVREAE,Cary,en,2006

"Went there for dinner with a childhood friend last week.

We started with an order of 4 of the appetizers intending to do a tapas kind of thing for dinner. (Everything but the pate).

The server was adamant that we had to select an entree. We explained that we wanted to look at the menu some more.

Truth be told, I had looked at the menu and honestly nothing spoke to me. I'm a bit of a simpleton and prefer simple food cooked well. The offerings here are a lot of things, simple isn't one of them.

After a bit of a stand off, the server departed in a huff with our order.

The appetizers were good, but like everything else there is just too much going on for me. Too many flavors competing on your tongue.

Eventually we ordered gumbo and a caprese salad.

The gumbo was simply okay. I had had a significantly better cup of gumbo at a popular restaurant in bucktown the night before. In addition there was a very slight fishy taste to the gumbo telling me it wasn't the freshest thing in the world.

The caprese salad was fine except for the balsamic vinegar, which was the refined version that is sweet. Typically the refined is put on ice cream and such. Don't know if it really works on a salad, definitely not for me.

I guess this all would have been ok if the bill for 3 people wasn't $300.

"My boyfriend and I dined here a few weeks ago for a date night and we were very impressed. We were both craving Eastern European food and Sophie's exceeded our expectations. The owner is from Bulgaria and has a lot of unique food and drinks on her menu.

We were able to make reservations and we asked for a booth. There are lots of fresh flowers and plants decorating this restaurant. We loved the vibes and definitely felt like we were transported to a restaurant in Europe. I started with a bourbon drink called the Boulevardier with Campari and it was delicious. My boyfriend had a bourbon. We ordered the Armenian figs appetizer, and my only complaint is the bacon was barely cooked. That is on me though because I should have specified we like our bacon well done.

For our entrees my boyfriend had the Balkan's wine kebab and I had the stuffed cabbage rolls. My entree was really good, but next time I'm ordering the wine kebab. The flavors were amazing! It consisted of slow roasted chicken, veggies and rice. The bartender was our server and she was wonderful. We both can't wait to return.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREN3ZXWk9BEAE,Cary,en,2056

"This experience was underwhelming and expensive for the price. Although it is marketed to be a book store, you can't really look at the books and you're not allowed your laptops at the bar in the case you want to have a drink and work. The hostess wasn't going to seat me at first and then decided she did have an empty seat at the bar for a couple hours and I felt a bit of judgement passed since I was alone. And on that note, bar requires reservations. Food was mediocre and overpriced. It just ultimately seemed like based on how you were dressed and how you looked, you may get better service than others.

I called back they sent me to voicemail twice , I didn’t have an issue with it , went in she took my order and started talking to herself communicating threats I still didn’t say anything to her she went to the back to talk to her coworkers which one who also put her hands on someone who was with me . The police came and literally did nothing , a caucasian male not sure if he was the owner or a manager who wasn’t there pulled up last minute didn’t ask if everybody was ok or what happened he proceeded to say “ yall are banned because these are my two best employees” which I mentioned to the police to make sure he doesn’t delete the footage since those are his “best” employees to cover   them .

From the moment I opened my shrimp lo mien and sesame chicken, I was impressed by the inviting aromas that wafted from each dish.
The menu offered an extensive selection of classic Chinese dishes, ranging from General Tso's chicken to vegetable lo mein. Each item I ordered was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The attention to detail in preparation was evident, with ingredients and a balance of flavors that made every bite a delightful experience.
The efficiency of the take-out service was commendable. My order was ready for pickup within the promised time, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.
Portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I had enough for a satisfying meal and leftovers for the next day. This value for money made the experience even more enjoyable.

First the hostess would not let us sit at the table where there would be no sun in our eyes.  Later the waitress let us move to that table.  One of my guests has food allergies. She ordered a  pizza and made it clear she could not eat onions or she would get ill.  She was half way into the pizza and noticed the onions (hard to notice, so cooked down).  The waitress was very apologetic, said it was a kitchen error, and offered to give a discount on the bill.  The discount was $2!  My guest talked to the manager (who was also the uncooperative hostess) and told her how unsatisfactory a $2 discount was, since she was going to be ill from the pizza.

"Very good lunch specials. Their food is consistently good and the prices are really good. Most times, I get tea with my lunch special. Even when I get a coke, my bill is only $15, including a $2 tip.

Highly recommended, and will continue to return to enjoy the items on the lunch special menu. They close at 3pm Monday through Saturday. They are closed on Sundays.

Please be patient with the staff and remember to tip kindly...",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbjVuc29nRRAB,San Francisco,en,4785

"This used to be our favorite Chinese take out spot, but they significantly increased their prices and the portion sizes shrunk. Also, the really nice lady who worked the counter is gone.

"Went here to get food for my girl about a week ago and they were all sold out! My girlfriend was pissed and wanted to blast them for the lack of food, but after being the person to walk in the store each time, I see why they are always sold out. The food is on point and the staff are friendly and down to earth. She can complain about it all she wants but these ppl know what they’re doing. Best gumbo hands down. I even started going for myself without my girl knowing lol. If they sold out just come back Chile!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdThhMjd3RRAB,New Orleans,en,6241

"These people in this restaurant were very rude. They got mad at legit questions quickly. This place was very hostile, and frightening. My family and I went here for a meal, and got blatant disrespect about our order, our refund, and so many other things that are baffling! The lady who was behind the register actually threatened my husband that we HAD TO CALL THE POLICE. While we called the police; they were just laughing. This is was so unacceptable. I will be going farther than this post because nobody at this food place seemed to care.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkcHBueERnEAE,Charlotte,en,2506
"After years of trying, we finally coordinated the timing of a visit to New Orleans that allowed a reservation for lunch at Dooky Chase. It also coincided with a monster rain storm that saw crazy street flooding with 6 inches per hour falling from the sky and submerging the streets.

The staff could not have been more welcoming, nor the dining room more elegant. I absolutely had to try the Creole gumbo, and it's now my favorite gumbo in New Orleans (sorry, Mr. B""s).  The meal was excellent, the service above and beyond. And with suggested wine pairing were spot on.

When it was time to leave, the water was up to the steps leading out to the street. The hostess insisted we leave through the back door where the water had not yet reached and led us through the kitchen, a fascinating side trip by itself. She then waited with us in the parking lot under our Uber arrived. Talk about commitment to customer service!

It was a wonderful experience on an historically bad weather day.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbUx5U2VREAE,New Orleans,en,5993

Yikes. In a food and service oriented town it should not take 45 minutes to get a glass of wine with a half empty restaurant. We were going to order an entree but it took 1.5 hours to get our drinks and an appetizer so no thanks. Quality of the food was nothing to write home about either. Nice decor though.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREOWJLb3BBRRAB,New Orleans,en,5476
I have always been confused by this listing as it appears a duplication of an Antoine’s Restaurant listing. Today I had the Réveillon Lunch at Antoine’s. I asked the manager and he had no idea. This rating therefore is for my great experience at Antoine’s. The food was plentiful and delicious and my server could not have been better. This was a totally enjoyable experience at a great restaurant.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWNHZQZHNRRRAB,New Orleans,en,5347

"NOTE: this restaurant is also know as El Sabor online. No frills little dive place. Excellent food and great customer service. We got the carna asada super and al pastor super burritos. Meat was good quality, beans were obviously home made, and they did  the burritos “El dorado” style, where they finish the burrito on the grill so the shell has a little char/smokiness to it. So good. Salsas homemade and had lots of flavor with a good kick. This place is across the street from our fav Vietnamese soup place, Pho Leun Fat, bonus for us when family is divided on what to get for dinner.
