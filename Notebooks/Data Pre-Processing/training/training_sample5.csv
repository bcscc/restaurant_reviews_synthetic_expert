"02-08-2024

Stopped in for a pre-gig meal and some drinks before my Mardi Gras ball.

Was greeted right away and grabbed a seat at the bar.

Started off with a Goose Island IPA and ordered the Vitascope Burger with fries.

After my meal I got the Smoked Old Fashioned as my after dinner cocktail.

Glad I stopped by before my gig. The staff were very friendly and made my visit extremely comfortable.

I'll definitely be back.

Thank you Vitascope Hall!

Much love,

Maestro",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkME55cUhnEAE,New Orleans,en,5846

"I visited this lication around 8:30 pm. I paid for the salad bar. All the lettuce was brown. Half of the vegetables needed to be filled or changed. I asked if they could refill the pasta. I was told there was no more pasta by 2 female workers. 5 min later I asked the male employee, he refilled it.

I went home and ate my food, about 3 hours later I vomited all the food back up.

I will never ""ever"" eat there ""ever"" again.

Also, they spec you to give them tip on every transaction you go in there they have a tip basket sitting in the front after being so expensive they spec you to give them tip.

Food was great but service and atmosphere I was really disappointed in! The cashier let us stare at the Today‚Äôs specials forever before she showed us there was a menu. We dined in and took a number placard only to find out we had to get back up to get our food. The whole vibe of the restaurant just seemed empty and a lack of energy.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbXZuMFZnEAE,San Francisco,en,4647
"Worst experience I've ever had. The chili literally burst through the cup while I was driving home. Didn't realize until I opened it. My steak was also overcooked. I brought it back to the restaurant, but the gap-toothed manager was useless and told me there was nothing she could do.

"This Wendy‚Äôs is trash!! I‚Äôm here at the drive thru waited ten minutes line never moved.

So I waited she never came out and guess who‚Äôs back at the drive thru. I finally ordered after waiting for so long, there was no lemonade of course.

UPDATE: by the time I got my food I guess the manager or whoever the guy was must had time to quickly read my review .. He tried to check me at the drive thru..  and he said ‚Äú I remember you were just in here and you were not waiting ten minutes and whispered that‚Äôs all you all are good for..‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming he said that pertaining to my review.Then he tried to apologize for the service after smh.. Well if you‚Äôre reading this again do a better job and stop letting the other employees chill at the window and please clean that dirty drive thru window and that nasty looking lemonade machine since you like to read reviews.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaDRueVlnEAE,Boston,en,1198

"I remember beeps from back in the day & it's not what it used to be. I know everything changes but beeps isn't beeps anymore. Aside from the prices going up (much like everything else rite?) I remember beeps burgers being authentic & their famous beeps special sauce isn't anything close to what it used to be - at all. They got rid of one of their best dishes, the fried shrimp basket, that really hurt & the last time I had one of their 1/4 pounder burger baskets it tasted so processed. This 'new gen' thing isn't always the best. I sure do miss the old beeps when it was the real Beeps burgers.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqX0piQ3dRRRAB,San Francisco,en,4774

I love this Subway and the way the owner run her shifts.  It‚Äôs always a vibe when we go in and the owner there.  She definitely make sure her customers have fun while buying.  This store definitely a 10/10,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWaGVpanRBRRAB,Atlanta,en,759
"Solid Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas topped with a variety of fresh ingredients and perfect for a relatively tasty, quick, and affordable meal. The concept is pretty similar to CAVA -- you can either build your own by choosing a base, main, and toppings, or you can pick from one of their chef-curated options. I usually opt to build my own with their salmon fillet or roasted butternut squash over kale, and topped with all the veggies and hummus. All of their veggies are super fresh, and their sauces all pack a ton of flavor (watch out for the spicy ones -- they actually are quite spicy). Their salmon fillets tend to be very small and a touch dry, as I assume they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, but they still pack a good flavor.

Although the food is solid, it's generally not my first choice for fast-casual Mediterranean fare, as (1) they're not always aware of which allergens are in their food, and (2) despite being a fast-casual spot, service can often be quite delayed.

Starting with the first -- the staff is wonderful at handling dietary restrictions; they'll put on new gloves, make sure your order is on a clean service (i.e., new foil or bowl), and avoid working on other orders at the same time as yours. However, I'm worried they haven't been told what all the allergens are in all of their ingredients. For example, I've received their gluten-free falafel pita box at several catered office lunches, and, unfortunately, ended up feeling pretty sick afterwards. Although I appreciate that they have a gluten-free pita (although it does taste pretty dismal) and that they have gluten-free options for desserts and sides, I don't believe their falafel is gluten-free (or maybe it's something in the rice or one of the toppings...I'm not entirely sure what it is or if there's just some cross-contamination, but something in those boxes definitely isn't sitting right with me).

Beyond dietary restrictions, the only other drawback to Roti is that it's not always as speedy as advertised, which is not at all the fault of the employees. Every time I go in, there are usually only 1-2 people working the entire restaurant, fielding a slew of both in-person and mobile orders. This naturally creates a delay in getting out all orders; for example, I'll sometimes wait upwards of 30+ min. for a line of five or so in-person customers because the staff is so swamped with mobile orders. On the flip side, if you get a mobile order, definitely go to pick it up instead of using their delivery service (which includes third-party apps like UberEats, as Roti opts to use their own drivers for those services). I usually have to wait over 45 min. for a delivery order, despite the quoted wait time of 15 min. and that my apartment is less than 2 miles away from the restaurant.

All in all, I think Roti is a solid place for fresh, flavor-packed Mediterranean bowls, salads, and pitas. However, I would recommend caution if you have dietary restrictions or if you're in a huge rush.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkczdhbmFnEAE,Washington,en,5086
"Ordered online with Uber eats and went to pick up at the time they told me. My order wasn‚Äôt made for another 20+ minutes. While I was waiting the fries were sitting in the bag getting cold.
When the order was finally handed to me I asked if he can check if the fries are hot or not and to replace them if they are cold. The employee got an attitude with me saying ‚Äòwe make sure the fries stay under the heat lamps‚Äô and I responded ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been standing here for 20 minutes and I can tell you that they were not under the heat lamps and sitting in the bag‚Äô
He then replied ‚Äòwell we are backed up and I can‚Äôt do anything about it, you can just go online and say something there‚Äô
Upon getting home the fries were NOT hot and the burgers were made so sloppily and packaged without care that the burgers fell apart after one bite making it almost impossible to finish.
Spent $31 on 2 burgers and fries and got the worst service I‚Äôve had in a very long time.

"Coming into the restaurant, my group of friends and I were expecting to get a nice, QUICK, tasty meal. But, we were met with the exact opposite. To start, we were greeted with a foul stench of cigarettes and weed. Something definitely not appropriate for most people especially young children and teens. Now, onto the food. The pastas were bland and my marinara pasta had a pool of water on the bottom. The sandwiches were not any better. They were salty, chewy and had an uneven texture. To add on, after the span of 5 seconds, the gravy from the roast beef quickly transferred to the bread and made it extremely soggy. Hence adding to its uneven texture. Not only that, the plates were dirty. The restaurant was also unable to record their orders properly, thus leaving my friends to starve and suffer as they watched everyone else eat. My friends and I then checked the reviews on the restaurants. They talked about recent food poisoning, and other liabilities. As soon as we read these reviews, it became clear that they were true. Finally, we would like to end with a warning; please do not come to this restaurant as the food does not taste good,  the restaurant does not practice hygiene, and is overall unsafe.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMGRUUlNBEAE,New Orleans,en,6074

"The food is good but the service is disappointing and negligent. It's one of the best Afghan restaurants in Queens, their main entrees are plentiful and of good quality, but I would avoid their appetizers.

I came here with a friend on a weekday night, around 7:30 - 8:00 PM) and the restaurant was not busy and plenty of tables were available. When we asked if we could sit on a particular 4-seat table), we were told no because the restaurant may get busy later. That's understandable, but then it was given to another 2-person party a little while later, which was odd. It also took them a long time to take our order, when the restaurant wasn't very busy. I also had to get up every time I needed something (soda, napkins, utensils, dessert). The table next to us may have been having the same issue. They wanted drinks but no one helped them either - I ended up helping them get their sodas.

"I have visited this business since my childhood. My uncles, parents, and all my relatives used to eat here after work or on their days off, either dining in or taking food home. We never had issues. The women working at the counter were always friendly, always smiling. The same when paying at the cash register. But I don't know, in recent years, they have changed ownership, I suppose, and the staff as well, leading to a drastic change. The people there, especially those working at the front, always seem busy. That's not the problem. The issue is their attitude. They look at you with complete disdain if you're not from their country. And even though I'm of a white complexion, it's not that big of a deal, but just for not being Dominican, I would say, they have a very arrogant attitude. And if one complains to the person at the cash register, total support, I think they cover for each other. The customer service is terrible, terrible, terrible. How do they expect someone to give them a tip with such an attitude? And they don't just expect it, they demand it, that's the worst part. I'm giving it one star because that's what it asks for, but honestly, this business doesn't even deserve one star. Moreover, people are even drinking at the counter. That never happened before. This business is going to fall soon. I'm warning my family and friends not to go to this place because the people are rude. Lately, I've noticed that the food is coming out disgusting.

"Food was decent, but everyone in my party left with a bad taste in their mouths after we were very rudely chastised and lectured about asking to split the check by our waiter, who was clearly having a bad night even though he already had his mandatory 20% gratuity added into the nearly $900 bill from our table. It might be annoying to you, but if the paying customer asks to split the bill at the end of the meal, you should smile and do it without complaining and making everyone feel awkward.

"TLDR: Busy casual spot, with an Americanized twist to Vietnamese food. Non-Vietnamese waiters do not know their menu. Food is edible.

I came in with a party of 8 Vietnamese some tourists and some local to Virginia. We were greeted promptly and politely from the waitress. Since there were 8 of us, a lot of menu items were ordered, which included egg rolls, spring rolls, rice, pho, and a vegetarian dish. The menu itself is very beautiful, but the actual food definitely looks nothing like what is pictured.

The service:
Our waitress was very nice, took our order, and repeated it to us. The appetizers came out within 10 minutes, but the main entrees came out, no exaggeration, 45 minutes later. I asked for extra beansprouts, as the existing amount they gave was enough for ants, and later on found out that they gave the entire table extra and charged for it. This would have been nice to know beforehand that this would be extra, which definitely was not the case. We also ordered a banh mi, but after over an hour, we told them not to bring it, as it was taking too long. Our drinks were full, but had to politely ask them for it.

The food:
The food all came out at sporadic times, with the children's food coming out 1 hour after the appetizers, again, no exaggeration. Given the restaurant's name, half of the table decided to order pho, and our waitress got it all wrong. We ordered the ""Pho Tai Nam"" and got the ""Pho Tai Lan"" My table being Vietnamese, pronouncing it correctly, thought that this non-Vietnamese waitress was pronouncing it incorrectly but giving us the correct order. Upon the first 2-3 bites, we were certain that we did not order this entr√©e, and asked the waitress and manager what this was? They kept repeating ""Pho Tai Lan"" and we were like this does not seem right. Anyways, I found a menu on another table that hadn't been pre-bussed in about an hour, and went through it. Saw that they had both a ""Pho Tai Nam"" and a ""Pho Tai Lan"" (For the record, there is no such thing as ""Pho Tai Lan"" so be aware that this proprietary to the restaurant. This is essentially beef pho with the beef being stir-fried with garlic and topped on the pho. sounds good but the beef was over-cooked and tough)
Message to the non-Vietnamese waitress: Please double check with your Vietnamese patrons on their Vietnamese order using your menu.

Management:
Management was a Vietnamese kid who spoke very softly and decided to give us 50% off of two bowls of pho (there were 4 total on our table), which was nice. We spoke to him in Vietnamese throughout our time in the restaurant to get things sorted out, but he was so timid and not confident in his communication. Not much got resolved.

Conclusion:
This restaurant is definitely catered more to Americans who would like to get a basic feel on what Vietnamese food is. The food is mediocre, at best, but maybe this restaurant is catering to the area. Pho Viet USA is a casual spot, with a fancy menu, and a poor food presentation. The prices are high, a little too high, given the food presentation, taste, service, and restaurant ambiance. Would I go back? No. Would I suggest this to an American? Yes. Vietnamese? No.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREem9uQzZBRRAB,Washington,en,4976

I liked that most customers appeared local and groups of families. We ordered Irish breakfast, breakfast specials and waffles.  Irish breakfast was pretty good which had Irish bangers and other types of sausages that tasted like blood sausage .   The hash browned seemed a little undercooked.  Overall I felt that their savory breakfast was decent but the sweet breakfast such as pancakes and waffle were just ok .  They were mostly dry and floury , even adding syrup didn‚Äôt make it better.

"We ordered three different bowls of pho and they were mediocre at best; a little bland for our taste and lacked the aromatics and depth of flavor.  Could have also been because it was dinner time and the broth wasn't as fresh.  The atmosphere was what you would expect from a hole in the wall restaurant.  The service was bad.  We ordered Goi Ga (salad w/ chicken) as our appetizer and never got it.  We never got waters or even offered if we wanted drinks.  They didn't know what fish sauce was so definitely no Vietnamese working that evening.  After 3 tries, he did eventually figure out what we were asking for.  Our server seemed to be hiding in the kitchen most of the time.  We waited a long time after finishing our food before I had to go back there to get him to get our bill.

"We visited Blue Bayou later in the evening when we were out looking for an after dinner drink and some dessert. The atmosphere looked inviting, and a quick review of their sidewalk menu lead us to believe we had found the place.  There weren‚Äôt many people in the restaurant but the bartender looked like a ball of frenetic energy. She was running around and asked us if we had been waited on yet, we said no and then she rushed away. A few minutes later, an engaging server stopped by and took our order. We ordered two desserts and four drinks. The desserts arrived long before the drinks and were not as shown in the menu. The menu describes a large slice of banana fosters cheesecake topped with sliced bananas and whipped cream. We received a sliver of cheesecake with no bananas. The sliver wasn‚Äôt enough for two. Three of our four drinks arrived after we finished our desserts, one drink was MIA. Mine was supposed to have rum in it but I couldn‚Äôt taste any. I chalked that up to the nutmeg on top. Another drink was supposed to be a lemon drop and tasted like water and lemon. We knew, with 100% certainty that the drinks were heavily watered down when the fourth drink finally arrived. It was supposed to be one of their signature drinks, an Old Fashioned. What is typically a beautiful dark caramel liquid, with a small amount of ice, dark cherry, bitters, sugar or simple syrup and maybe an orange slice came out looking like a slightly beige glass of water with a maraschino cherry and filled to the brim with ice. It was so watered down that the bourbon was hardly detectable. No simple syrup or sugar was used. And the bitters that make an OF so special were missing as well. Our server was great, I really wish I remembered his name!  The music was interesting‚Ä¶ but we won‚Äôt be going back.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqemRDNS1RRRAB,New Orleans,en,5964

Food is what you would expect from a Subway, double chocolate cookies 10/10. The bottled drinks aren't cold very, so you may need to chill them or add ice. I think it's just their mini fridge.

"Worse dining experience of my life. Definitely-  if I could. Service was bad, restroom was bad, & the food was so horrible I was sick immediately after eating just a few bites!! I‚Äôd rather burn my $100+ spent there than eat there again. 1st time visiting  New Orleans & this experience completely ruined it for me & my family. We walked in & the vibe wasn‚Äôt friendly at all. I should have known to trust my gut feeling. The server coldly handed us menus & left. I was debating if we should leave cuz he didn‚Äôt come back for like 15mins, but I wanted to give him another chance. He quickly took our orders & left with a cold expression. My son ordered dirty rice & he said we don‚Äôt have that. So I‚Äôm like ok maybe he‚Äôs having a bad day it‚Äôs whatever. Wrong!! While waiting for our food, I went to use the restroom. Doors were broken for both stalls. Toilet paper roll on the ground & one didn‚Äôt even have toilet paper. There was no soap or paper towels. It was so sketchy, I decided to hold myself until we got to another bathroom. When we finally got our food it didn‚Äôt look bad but after tasting the food I felt sick right away. And wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just me. But nope!! Tried the jambalaya rice & it tasted like sour partially uncooked rice. Horrible!! Took a few bites of my seafood boiled. The potato & corn textured seemed ok but the flavor was very strange. You‚Äôd think since Louisiana is know for their seafood boils it‚Äôll be at least edible. I don‚Äôt know what seasoning they put in their seafood boiled, but ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. I ate one shrimp & it tasted like I was eating raw stanky fish. I had a few other people tried it & said it was bad too. I immediately decided we shouldn‚Äôt eat anymore of our food. I didn‚Äôt don‚Äôt want us to get food poisoning since we were on a road trip & had many stops to go yet. Our bill was $100+ for the most nastiest food ever. My husband was so kind he still left a tip despite how horrible everything was. I literally was trying hard not to vomit as we were walking out of the restaurant. I barely made it out before vomiting outside & on the way to the public restroom a few blocks away. It was so bad I couldn‚Äôt get rid of that nasty taste in my mouth. I drank half a bottle of coke & ate ice cream to cleanse my palate. Finally stopped my urges to vomit. My hands stank like raw fish even after washing my hands 20 times at 5 different bathrooms. I have never left a online review for a restaurant before, but I want to warn people about how horrible this experience was.

Every delectable bite forced my eyes shut so I could deeply enjoy the freshness, flavor and texture. While I was enjoying coffee the chef sent complimentary Rosemary & Lemon Custard Madeline's. It was an innovative way to approach this classic pastry. My only critique is the custard on top was so good I wanted more. Very light, fresh, and balanced melody of flavors. The consistency was reminiscent of a fusion between a scone and puff pastry. You can tell the French invited fries by how well the fries here complimented every dish. It was such a phenomenal experience, I found myself making reservations for the next day halfway through brunch and I am happy to say the food, service and entertainment are consistently great here. The fancy French atmosphere at Hotel Monteleone was fit for a Queen and the bathroom attendant cleaned the stall prior to each guests use. This is a must try spot in The French Quarter.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5cWN2UkJREAE,New Orleans,en,5697

"Came here with a friend while we were in the area to check out Kroger. Webwere greeted warmly upon arrival, the place was clean, bright, and looked new which helped the place look inviting.

Their menu selection is VAST! I'm talking from wings, fries, to east asian food items like spring rolls,
noodles( fried and soup wise),  all present which was the first time I experienced a restaurant like that that was not a buffet( I'm from the east coast). I liked it!

My friend ordered lemon pepper (dry) with shrimp fried rice. I bought lemon pepper dry with french fries and my goodness th portions were plentiful for the price we paid which was such a plus in our book!
.we loved the lemon pepper as they were seasoned to perfection, yum! Friend said the fried rice was bland as it had little to no seasoning. The fries were good and crisp and came with some sort of sauce which I think is their homemade house sauce which taste like a mixture of Siracha, mayo and something else maybe mustard to give it a tang.

"A disappointing experience all around. The service is inattentive and rests on their notoriety assuming everyone will just agree it‚Äôs amazing. We arrived for a 6:30 reservation and was told as we started to order that there was no crab available. Over half of their menu are crab based dishes. This seems to be a problem with sourcing and ensuring the restaurant is properly prepared to serve what‚Äôs on their menu. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller and were very disappointed. There were no bread crumbs to be found on these oysters, the spinach looked like someone dumped a can of goopy spinach on top, and they over baked the dish. I could bounce my fork off of the stiff spinach goop on top of the oyster. I waited for my waitress to ask how it was as we only ate two of them‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt ask, and when she came to remove them, I informed her they were not good. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell my boss‚Äù and carried them away. The ‚Äúboss‚Äù did not come to check with us and they indeed did charge for them. The main entres were mediocre and nothing to rave about.

"My friend and I went in on a Sunday for a quick, last minute brunch at 3pm. Hosts were great. Food was good. Our server, Valerie F., was not. Maybe she was ready to clock out, bad day, upset she was working on a Sunday... i'm not sure.

Valerie F. had the worst attitude taking our drink order, she was very impatient when taking our food order, she dropped the food off, and was never seen again. My friend went to the kitchen area to ask for a box and as he was walking back to the table, he overheard Valerie say, ""oh, he can come back here to get a box but not his check."" (Rude and uncalled for - considering she had not been back to our table to check on us at all). He turned right around, went back to Valerie , and asked for our check. For context, the restaurant closes at 4pm on Sundays. We paid (with the hostess by the way because Valerie did not come get our debit card) and were out of the doors at 4:05pm.

This was our first time visiting Dame's Chicken and Waffles in Cary and was extremely disappointed in the service and behavior of Valerie. Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this location and spending time and money in an establishment that condones this kind of behavior.

Dames Chicken and Waffles corporate office, restaurant management, and/or God himself should have a conversation with Valerie and I pray she has the day she deserves.

My son‚Äôs chicken tenders had a lot of bread and little chicken. To be fair the kids meals were $8.99.

FRESH and DELICIOUS FOOD. Service and hospitality are excellent. I am so enjoy the music playlist with the beautiful weather. Fantastic experience for dine in the patio. Definitely worth 10/10,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dEttOGhRRRAB,Atlanta,en,567
"I found Cafe Flora on HappyCow, which is an app that helps vegans and vegetarians find restaurant options in their area. I'm glad to say that this place definitely didn't disappoint.

As a vegan it can be super difficult to find good restaurant options so every time I find one I feel like I've struck gold. Even though this place isn't entirely vegan, there are enough options that it'll make most vegans very happy. I ordered the Saffron and Lobster Mushroom Risotto and the Madison cocktail.

The Risotto consisted of arborio rice, saffron, and lobster mushrooms among other ingredients. It didn't taste overly indulgent or heavily sweet or savory, rather it just had a very complimentary combination of flavors and a great texture which didn't warrant extra sugar or salt. I love it when menu items don't taste overly greasy or rich and they have a cleaner vibe about them. The Risotto was accompanied with a minimalist Arugula salad with a great lemon vinaigrette. So simple, yet clean. Good dishes don't need a million ingredients, just a handful of quality ones.

The Madison cocktail seemed like a modified Manhattan, using an earl grey infused vermouth rather than a traditional Italian vermouth in a Manhattan. Honestly, I'm not super educated with my liquors so I cannot speak too much to the complexity of the cocktail, but I can tell you that I really enjoyed it.

I'll definitely be coming back.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhXy11STBnRRAB,Seattle,en,4853

"I enjoy this Bojangles so much. I LOVE the drive-thru. What do we call it? Automated? AI? A robot? I don't know, but it is GLORIOUS not having to go back and forth with an actual person to order.

I get to save my people-ing energy for the pick up window, and they are always nice, probably because they haven't had to go back and forth with me for my order! Everything is relaxed and easy.

There is something here for introverts and extroverts. Extroverts get to people at the pick up window, and introverts don't have to go through the horror of communicating their order to an actual person.

I am on the neurodivergent end of the introvert spectrum, so probably more of an extreme introvert.

Automatically we were impressed with how friendly they are because we pulled up a few minutes after closing! They treated us with the most respect and smile! 2nd, I would give them 10 stars for cleanliness! That made me feel really good because a lot of food places make you really pray over it!
Now here's the winner!! The Gumbo!! Since they were treating us like family, we shared the good news of why we were in town, celebrating  a birth! They gave my husband an extra container of Gumbo and glad they did! I told them I do not eat Gumbo but I'll taste some when we made it back to where we were staying! I was impressed and now I will say I will eat Gumbo but only from there and my husband really enjoyed his! We are suppose to leave but now will be here for a few more days so my husband said he's going back!!!

"This hidden gem is a must try!! The staff are very friendly and will be helpful if you need assistance navigating through all of the delicious options on the menu. The food is AMAZING! Literally everything is filled with flavor. The jerk turkey wings are my favorite with the perfectly cooked and seasoned rice and peas. All of the veggies are great. Not your typical spot where the protein is usually the star of the show and the sides are mediocre. Here, you get flavor in every single dish. You can‚Äôt go wrong with the greens, cabbage, green beans, &/or broccoli. The creole spaghetti is a hit too! The manager/owner of the spot was also kind enough to let me try the rasta pasta on the house recently and it was also delicious. You really can‚Äôt go wrong with anything on the menu here‚Ä¶. And they are consistent! Ive eaten here many times and the flavors and great portions are sheets the same.
My only knock on this place is the location (inside the Greenbriar Mall) because I know they would be even more booming in a better location! This is a spot that truly deserves community support and I hope to see them outgrow the mall.

They had 3 - 5 options for breakfast and 2 options for drinks on the online ordering app. Ridiculous. I will never be back nor do I recommend it.

I tried green chicken curry (oh man, those kafir lime leaves flavor  in it), Tofu fries & a glass of wheat beer stout.
Everything was amazing, do not expect to get free portion of rice, you need to pay extra $3 for it (but that‚Äôs ok ).

Really all of the sides are a must try. The fried salmon and wings paired with the hot sauce was nearly perfection. The drinks were also really good‚Äîsweet, but good. Portion sizes are very generous. Also one thing that really stood out to me‚Äî the chef was really sweet and personable!! She came up and addressed my boyfriend and I by our names (I don‚Äôt know how she remembered, I was pretty shocked when she did that lol) and asked if everything was okay and what we liked and didn‚Äôt like.

"Ok I won't fault the place for the environment. It is more geared for the younger crowd or someone into a more excitable scene. The music, the hookah, and drinks along with the occasional weed smoking is definitely for a specific crowd. Now when it comes to the food, I give that full 5 stars. I was impressed. I had the lobster sliders with the salmon bites as an appetizer. They were AMAZING. The sauce, ugh I could not stop dipping my fries in. I was drawn to this place because of a Google search and the pictures of the food looked great. Now when you actually try it..... . The chef that day deserves a raise. The bun the lobster sliders were on was not hard, but like crisp and soft. The lobster was not chewy or felt over cooked. It was just right. I highly recommend grabbing a bite from here.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkMzdYYV9BRRAB,Atlanta,en,108

Ordered the spicy wings with the sauce on the side and the smell of the chicken by itself wasn't to pleasing and was completely unseasoned. However, it does pair well with the sauce once accompanied.

Ordered the shrimp and chicken fried rice also which was good. Note it is not Chinese fried rice so you won't get all the components such as mung bean sprouts and the rice is different. However, I was really impressed with the taste and freshness of this dish. I was looking for the best fried rice in DC and some of the reviews stated this was the place.

Food was barely warm, had ZERO spice and pretty much no flavor except for being overly sweet. The ""meat"" was mostly batter, chewy and tasted of old oil. Did they try to re-fry old chicken or was their oil just overdue for a change? I don't know, but the food was not good at all. I had to toss it. Pork eggroll was a little more edible, but soft and on the chewy side.  It did not smell of old oil like the General Tso's, but maybe the eggroll was old too?

Also didn't want to make more fried rice, 45 minutes before closing despite steady traffic in drive thru and customers still coming into restaurant. Location also consistently fails to provide total of meal at the speaker, which would expedite people paying with cash to have money ready while you wait 2 minutes to be acknowledged at the pickup window.

Honestly I don't even know where to start. There aren't enough wonderful words to describe this authentic Italian restaurant. My husband and I love traveling and trying different cuisines and restaurants. I have to say in all my life I have never been to a place where I was more impressed with the staff than anything else. Don't get me wrong the food was AMAZING but the staff were so warm and welcoming. We truly felt like we were part of the family. I seriously thought they seated us and mistook us for a different family with a reservation because of how accommodating and attentive they were. We live 4 hours away but will absolutely be returning every time we are in the area! I've already told others about this wonderful place and they are looking forward to going.

"We went to the Felix‚Äôs at the French Quarter the evening of 4/16/24. Not having been back to New Orleans for a few years, I was excited to return for the char grilled oysters. We have been multiple times in the past and the food has been great, and staff so friendly but unfortunately not this time. When arriving, there was an African American female hostess with glasses. Multiple tables were open but she told us we would have to wait for a 2 top table to be cleaned. We asked why we couldn‚Äôt sit at a 4 top, when she had seated other parties with 2 people at the 4 top tables. She smirked and refused to provide us with respond, instead just ignoring us. We made the decision to go elsewhere and when telling her same, she again just smirked as though she was proud of her actions. When we told the couple behind us of what happened, they also left the location and the hostess continued to smirk about her decision to treat us as she had. I made the mistake of calling the Lakefront location, instead of the French Quarter, and spoke to the supervisor. She was appalled by the fact an employee of Felix‚Äôs would treat customers as we were treated. She said the situation was totally mishandled and if it had been her location, she would have marched up front and made the situation right. She also recommended I write this review to advise the owner of what had happened. We have since left a voicemail for management, with no response but this type of customer service will keep me from returning. Instead, we went to Acme around the corner where the staff was friendly, food was great, service was efficient, and we weren‚Äôt discriminated against as we were by that hostess. Highly recommend Acme if you are in the area and looking for oysters and/or po boys!

"The employee expediting the food was incredibly rude. My father used the self ordering system and believed he ordered two sandwiches. When his order was called and we discovered there was only one the person who gave him the food simply said ‚Äúno you didn‚Äôt‚Äù and walked back to his station. I stepped in to ask a follow up question, I was then told that he ordered a meal without a sandwich. At this point my father got back in line to order another. While we were figuring this out my order was called and I missed my number. After waiting a few minutes I inquired about my order and the same person told me ‚ÄúI called this 3 times, don‚Äôt ask me about your order‚Äù my wife commented that he could have call it louder and he proceeded to swear quietly as we were walking away calling her several inappropriate words.

I understand that it's a 'drive thru' but communication would've been sufficent, even if it was a "" sorry m'am, cars only"" INSTEAD I was mocked and humilated! The staff laughed hysterically as they served the car ahead of me, joking with the current customer and looking back at me shaking their head because they have never seen a mom who was willing to do whatever was needed to feed her children. I didn't served, but I did get embarressed!

It was just crunchy white vinegar cabbage ü§¢ The mac and cheese was just cheese noodles. No flavor whatsoever. The candy yams are actually okay But I mean, It's not hard to boil a sweet potato and add cinnamon and butter.

"$23 for IMITATION Crab meat on a potato is crazy. I got the seafood potato and they didnt even put the sausage or broccoli on it. Charging that much for IMITATION Crab and 3 shrimp is robbery.

"Bojangles is dead. This food was nothing short of disgusting, we threw it away. We ordered bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits with bo rounds and chicken supremes. The old grease taste was putrid and overwhelming, the biscuit overcooked and hard, the egg burned, it was inedible. What a waste and the drive thru service guy was inept too. Never again with the price of fast food. It used to be good for fast food standards, not anymore. Just wait in line at Chic-fila next door...pass this joint by.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbkx2Qnp3RRAB,Charlotte,en,2319
"My absolute favoriteeee Italian place. Pretty large portions so I recommend doing family style, you'll definitely be taking things home.

The service was so so kind. This particular location has pickup/take out with outdoor seating which we didn't know until arriving. They were patient when we ordered and the chef even ended up coming out to say hi.

Good date spot, bathrooms nearby and pretty good parking. Ask for extra napkins tho!

Me and a friend got the gnocci and broccoli, lasagna, fried mozzarella, and the cannolis. Stuffed when we go back to the car with about half taken home as leftovers. Very much homemade taste with a lottt of butter ü§§

A friend of mine wanted me to try this this place and I am glad I did. The menu options were pleasantly overwhelming. I ordered the spicy fried wings and hot wings for pickup. The pickup process was smooth and easy and the staff were incredibly helpful. The food was amazing.

Honestly they have a dress code but the restaurant is not fancy at all. It‚Äôs a tourist trap if you ask me. The food was very disappointing.

"Paid $17.50 for a pathetic excuse for a chicken sandwich and $15 for a blue moon. I understand airport food is always marked up but this is completely unacceptable. A cold bun, chicken, lettuce, and tomato. It's drier than the Sahara. I was told after I said something that cheese was an additional $1.25. Don't waste your money or time",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxNTVhUk5BEAE,Chicago,en,2976
"Unfortunate. I wish I can five this restaurant more, but here me out. I ordered the chicken sandwich and a beer and let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious. For an airport chicken sandwich, it was really good. The reason for the 3 stars is service. I sat to the bar and since I got there, the bartender kept moving me or telling me to move my labtop or anything around to make space for other customers. I‚Äôm a small guy so I‚Äôm not taking up space but she insisted and that‚Äôs really rubbed me the wrong way. I‚Äôm a customer too. Regardless besides the poor service and feeling like I shouldn‚Äôt even be here, the food was great!

He mentioned that the place was spacious and clean, creating an inviting and perfect atmosphere for a relaxing meal. He absolutely loved the Hainan Chicken with rice, praising its flavorful taste.

I opted for a trio of dishes: the flavorful Curry Chicken, the melt in your mouth Beef Rendang with perfectly cooked meat, and the Sambal Shrimp with a delicious and slightly sweet sauce.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEbXBDZjZ3RRAB,New York,en,4252

Edelmira was doing such a great job tonight! The place was packed and she was handling the store front by herself. With a BIG smile on her face which is an added bonus.

"Right on the corner of Mission and Geneva I found Geneva Steak. I walked into the dining room and looking at the seating reminded me of a classic restaurant with red leather booths all around.  I look at the menu on the wall and went for the French Burger, the order included a green salad and my choice of baked potato or rice pilaf. The burger was cooked fresh to order and while my order was being prepared I started with the salad, fresh iceberg lettuce, sliced carrots, red onions, peppers, tomatoes and ranch dressing, the French Burger came soon after, the plate was served by the Chef, a rectangular large bun that was soft and expertly toasted on the grill, usual burger setup, and the baked potato was split in half with melted butter on top. I was happy with the quality of the ingredients definitely a bargain for $13.99. The restaurant specializes on steaks, kabobs and bbq chicken. They have a selection of soft drinks, beers on tap, bottle beer. The place was clean and nice service all around.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWM2VPbUZREAE,San Francisco,en,4634
