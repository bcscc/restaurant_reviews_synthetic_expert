"Great service, friendly staff, DELICIOUS food! First time at Mixto and it did not disappoint. We went there for dinner and ordered ceviche mixto, birria taco’s and arroz con mariscos. The portions are very generous (two people couldn’t finish a starter, ceviche and a main, took some of it home) and everything is freshly made which makes them very flexible when it comes to food restrictions. I like the dim lighting because it made the dinner feel like date night on a Wednesday. Also, it is located in a quiet neighborhood which gives so much privacy and the time to properly enjoy your food without rushing to empty the table. Will visit them for brunch next time",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5N01iZ1B3EAE,San Francisco,en,4514

"The serenely decorated space of this restaurant caught our eye. The main attraction was the water cascading down the walls near the private canopies. It was definitely a delight to dine here as the atmosphere was aesthetically pleasing. Our table ordered the King Crab- steamed, with sauces on the side,  okra, Fried Calamari, Rice. The waitress brought out the Crab before it was cooked..I didn't realize how big it was but I got it any way. It was absolutely delicious .  The Okra was perfectly cooked, it still had a little bit of a crisp bite so it wasn't as slimy as you would think. The fried Calamari was cooked perfectly as well, it came with spicy mayo, which we enjoyed as well. I mean even the white rice was good. The customer service was impeccable as well. Overall a great dining experience.  Thank you yo all the staff that assisted us.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhdkkzcUdREAE,New York,en,3968
"Update: Try their very good soup!! Be prepared to wait for your food. Not a quick lunch by any stretch. Allow extra time, or get there early. From the time I got in line to when I received my order of soup and salad — it was over 30 minutes. Pretty good lunch! The soup was very thick, (like stew) and spicy so I added some beef broth I had a my office. Today I tried the chicken salad. Not as good as the beef Barbados I had last time. They still do not have a very mild option on salsa. All of the salsa choices were hot. Still Very busy and seating was hard to come by. The line was about 10 people deep when I showed up just after 12 on a Wednesday for lunch. Employees are friendly but seemed overwhelmed both times. Go outside of lunch hours, if you can. Today I did not feel the food made up for the long wait time. I don’t usually have a full hour for lunch.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX2JhNzFnRRAB,Dallas,en,3173
"These were some of the best empanadas we have ever had! We originally stopped here as part of a food tour. The food was so incredible that we stopped by again for lunch the next day!

"Salvio's has incredibly delicious food and their service is excellent.  My mom has sent me surprise pizzas at the pharmacy and they write a note from her on the inside of the box.  They deliver it with a smile because they know it's a surprise and I'll probably cry.
Anna delivered mine today and it was delicious as usual.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMHZPV1BnEAE,Cary,en,2222

The food is good but they had us waiting 2 HOURS for our order. They emailed saying our food was ready for pickup and when we got there we were waiting an hour. The service is horrible!

"This real mexican restaurant has changed its name to Martinez taqueria.
By real mexican restaurant I mean traditional cuisine. It tasted like my grandmother was cooking.
I mentioned to my wife that I felt like having huitlacoche(a mushroom that is harvested from corn) she asked at her work and someone mentioned the restaurant by it's former name.
I had a gordita with chicharrón en salsa verde while waiting for my huitlacoche quesadilla. The gordita was light tasting with a slight crunch  but filled with chicharrón and cotija cheese. The huitlacoche quesadilla was HUGE about 20 inches long filled with cotija cheese, chopped onions and of course tons of huitlacoche. Table side they have salsa roja and salsa verde. I WILL RETURN TO SAMPLE THE REST OF THE MENU!",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZcDRtRlNnEAE,Dallas,en,3635

Well then Lebowski's is the place to go to, my daughter and I went here for lunch and from the moment we walked in it was a vibe!

Thank you so much for your great atmosphere and hospitality.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MUs3blZnEAE,Charlotte,en,2518

"When our large family gathers we like to have sombeody else do the cooking. Lately that somebody has been Bambinelli's takeout. We love the basics here - Chicken and Eggplant Parm with a side of pasta, Calzones, Pizza, Lasagna and especially the large family salads. There is something for everybody on the menu. We gather up our orders and then send a runner over since we live next door in Garden Hills. But we have also used the delivery service and were pleased. We started doing this during the CoVid lockdown and it is one of the few good things to come out of that time. Instead of paying a small fortune to go to a Buckhead restaurant we get great food served with our own beverages around big table at home. Babies get put to bed on time, conversations around the table linger and there always seems to be enough food for leftovers. Bonnie Bambinelli would approve.  Bada Bing.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkME5PZHVRRRAB,Atlanta,en,446

"PLEASE it’s not hard to follow directions. Especially when I place an order, I can’t get a whole refund on delivery apps and the mistakes get very costly.

"Double Dragon used to be the best but recently, theyve dropped the ball. Food is always late, cold and with the price increase, food amount doesnt equal the price. Its a shame. I was a regular customer but no more. Theyre stingy and food is never consistant anymore. Also their menu prices is designed to make you order more than you should. In this economy, if youre going to charge people more for food then you should serve the right amount of food for it, not just stuff the container with rice and a lil amount of of whatever entre. Shame on you guys.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1azlYTXp3RRAB,New York,en,4384

"Such a unique pizza that absolutely hits. Their pizza is not the conventional pizza - but is pizza with an Ethiopian spin (though the dough and crust is great too). We ordered the Addis Ababa and the Merkato pizza and while both were good, the Addis Ababa pizza is one that I'll absolutely be coming back for. Similar to Heat da Spot, the staff is so nice and treat you like you're family. Super excited to go back and happy to have discovered this place :) Only note is - we had a pretty big party (6 people) and I think the space inside is pretty small. We had to sit in the patio so that's definitely something to keep in mind :)",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMV92THlRRRAB,Washington,en,5181

"Just got brisket and mac & cheese pre-flight. I should have known when all other restaurants had a line and this place had no line. I took a chance. I am sorry I did. The brisket had zero flavor other than the BBQ sauce they loaded on. The mac & cheese was the worst cheese sauce soup with boiled shells I have EVER had. Worst yet, rude, less than friendly employees to serve brisket $16.49 and mac $5.49. Never again.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKNHA2YzZRRRAB,Chicago,en,3101

"Extremely disappointed with the Bun Bo Hue dish that I ordered. The amount of food in this item was dismal compared to other dishes ordered from here.

"I have been to this Chick-fil-A four or five times since it opened about four months ago, and the experience has improved each time! They have a mostly brand new staff that is still learning, but the extremely negative tone of the reviews shared here does not match the quality of experiences I’ve had - The food was delicious, the staff was professional and attentive, the service was excellent and the store was clean!

As a former employee, I know Chick-fil-A has set the customer service bar high for its customers, and with this being a new location they certainly have room to grow in speed, accuracy and efficiency. However, to go a step further and demonize the community surrounding the store (as many reviews have done) is too far.

As you all know, Chick-fil-A traditionally operates stores in more affluent/middle class communities, and this particular store is located right on the boundary line between a high poverty neighborhood and a very affluent neighborhood in Charlotte. I can’t help but think this unique reality unfairly contributes to people’s perception of the store and its employees if the quality of service isn’t at the high standard they expect it to be.

In addition to providing great food and good service to customers, this store also provides over a hundred people with stable, high quality employment within walking distance of their homes. I’m not sure how many employees live in the community surrounding the store, but having employment options walkable to lower income residents is super rare in car-dependent cities like Charlotte, and it’s worth being excited about!

So don’t let these reviews keep you from giving this location a shot. Cut them some slack and give them some time to train their employees and develop them. And if the drive through line is long, park and walk in - 9 out of 10 times it’s faster anyway.

Thanks for reading - I’ll certainly be back!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdWRMRml3RRAB,Charlotte,en,2298

She was a big help and combined the small tables together so we could all sit. The food was delicious and the portion sizes for the platters were massive!!! And the pricing wasn’t that unreasonable, I would say that it fell into the medium/average price category. Beautiful interior and clean bathrooms as well. Plenty of vegetarian/vegan options! We would definitely recommend, beautiful restaurant in the heart of the French quarter near the French market.

We had a lovely lunch this past Monday and the outdoor dining area is fantastic!! We normally sit inside, but had our puppy with us and the outside was so pleasant.

Our food has always been top notch! We have tried many different dishes but come back to some of our favorites- this lunch was the max burger, dry rub wings and fries. All worthy contenders and perfect for a lunch!! I love the devil crab stuffed fish for dinner and my wife likes the bolognese. We have taken friends and none have ever been disappointed.

We have had some good servers and some just ok ones. Personally I love their tea and usually drink 3 glasses during the course of my meal. If my glass ever gets fully empty that is a red flag of poor performance in my opinion, unfortunately that has happened on most occasions.

"Wow what an experience! From the hostess to the chef our experience was phenomenal. Went for the omakase experience and will be back for sure. We were greeted by a very kind hostess who took our coats and led us to the bar while we waited for our sever- the bar was attentive, quick and very friendly even offering suggestions based on our usual drink types. Our server came to greet us at the bar and walked us to the Omakase area which was so beautiful — the details of the restaurant were just perfect.

Once we sat down our server went over the drink pairing with us and we opted to let him choose for us throughout the dinner (excellent decision). The chef came out to greet us and immediately started preparing fresh wasabi and getting right into the meal.

The food was delicious. They have a unique sushi experience with dry aging the fish. We were able to compare fresh and dry aged of multiple types and then moved on to Nigiri (and wow this was my favorite part). Everything we ate was delicious and we left very satisfied and will be back.

We didn’t take many photos as we were living in the moment but this place needs to be added to your must try date night spots ASAP.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNE5EeGxnRRAB,Atlanta,en,74
"I booked this venue for Valentine’s Day with my wife. $85 per person is reasonable so I booked it. We were greeted promptly and politely by the hostess. The restaurant was basically empty, which made me wonder why the booking time was so limited. It took a few minutes to be greeted and offered drinks, but the bar was busy so we understood. When we placed our order, we watched our drinks sit on the bar for 8 minutes before my wife got up and got them for us. When it came time to order from the fixed menu, I was concerned when they didn’t ask what temperature I wanted my filet. Come to find out, it’s only well done. They brought out my plate with mushrooms, some sort of potato, and a thin filet cooked WELL DONE. It was painfully obvious the steak was premade and microwaved to order. My wife got scallops and risotto, the scallops had a strong fishy smell to them, which is NOT in the norm. I sent my steak back to be prepared medium rare as a filet should be. The product they returned to me was BLUE RARE at best. At this point, I was annoyed. So I asked them to return the food and bring us our check. I gladly paid for my wife’s meal since she tolerated the scallops. The oxtail pie appetizer was bland, and the cappuccino tomato soup starter was good, but was maybe an ounce. To top it off, they brought h wife her dessert and sent back mine since I returned my meal, and requested it to be removed (I took one bite of my well done steak). While I understand they shouldn’t just hand stuff out, they should have at least made an effort to remedy the poor food quality. I don’t blame the server at all. Either way, I paid $113 for my wife’s meal that was mediocre at best. The risotto was bland and overcooked along with the overly fishy scallops. I hope management fixes this for future diners. Luckily, we found an Italian place down the street to eat.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkMXQzRERREAE,Dallas,en,3203

The secret to the success of this establishment is the staff. They are hard working, attentive, and always make you feel welcomed, like family. Bartenders usually know what you are drinking when you come back the 3rd time and are always quick to serve, even when there is no space at the bar. In the kitchen is the matriarch, Mama Henry, the Owners mother. She makes every sauces, flan, beans, and many more items from scratch.

Happy Hours are from open to 7:00PM on weekdays, their sangria, margaritas are strong and on point and come in many fresh fruit flavors.

Some must haves on the tapas are the empanadas, mofonguitos, pulpo, tostones and chorizo, bacon wrapped dates, canastitas de bacalao, for mains the churrasco, paella and salmon are amazing.

I used to bartend here for 6 years and I never once was tired of the food, this place is like family to me.

Truly a neighborhood gem.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNELV91ZXZBRRAB,New York,en,4427

"The bartender who wrote the drink  menu is EVERYTHING!!! I tried the pink squirrel, which is his grandmother’s old recipe, and it was great!!! Make sure you have the bread. It’s a sweet potato bread that’s absolutely delicious. I’ve even had breakfast here and it was absolutely delicious.

"3rd visit. First two were amazing, and this time definitely not......

We prefer to not dress up too much and sit in the bar area, and have always loved every minute of it. This time we were told the bar area was full (even though there were clearly empty tables) so we were led into the secondary dining area and it's a whole different world and not for us. We didn't order wine and my wife wasn't too hungry so only ordered a salad and a side dish, and the waitress didn't seem to be happy about that and didn't pay much attention to us. Also the bar area is calm and laid back but both dining are as loud as a high school cafeteria and for some reason no one even tries to keep their voices down. We could clearly identify voices from multiple tables across the room and it seemed to be normal. When my drink was gone she took it away and didn't ask if I wanted another. So no dessert for us, we ate and left. Would go back again, and put our foot down for the bar area, but not sure how much leverage we'll have with a $50 deposit on our reservation.......",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtNXZmeVJBEAE,New Orleans,en,6055

"Dim sum was ok, similar to other dim sum place that I have been.  I gave lower score on service as I count their valet parking as part of this restaurant review.  The valet people have extremely bad attitude.  They had many spots in the early morning.  We said we could pull to a spot that they wanted us to park as it would take 6 of us with a kid to get off the car and take our belongings.  The valet guy immediately yelled at us and asked us to get off the car.  No one was behind us at that time. We were nicely asking if we could park and we would still give tips.  The guy just said your car is not a luxury car.  What kind of valet parking attitude is this?   I would never come back to this restaurant as there are plenty of other better restaurants I can go.

Bad experience and wasted money. I ordered via Doordash and the food was not sealed or tamper proof packaging. Threw it in trash and warned my Twitter peeps. Sad this restaurant doesn't live in reality or simply doesn't care. Either way they are on their way to the dustbin of Charlotte history if they keep sending take-out orders packaged that way. As a Charlotte 'NATIVE' I don't give a hoot about this 'community member' b.s. the managers have responded in other critical reviews. If you suck...you suck.

My honey lemon pepper wings were undercooked completely!!! (Red center).. and the fries were overcooked completely and cold!!

Hopefully when employees start being replaced with robots then this establishment will be in the top 5 to start with…. I’m not basing this review off of 1 visit to this place… this is the 3rd and final visit! Each time the order was under or overcooked! Or stale! Or you’ll attempt to order chicken at 10 (they close at 11) and they’ll say they don’t have any chicken or fish left!!! Well why are you open? You don’t sell burgers!!!

"AVOID this restaurant!!! One of worst dining experiences ever. We had reservation at 05:30 for 5 people and when arrived we were told to head to bar had a mix up for our table. No one ever came to get us after said would just be a few minutes . We headed back up to hostess desk after waiting for amount of time we were told. We stood another couple minutes in the line near hostess desk and were finally called. The hostess desk is very unorganized and whole reservation system is very poorly managed. We headed to our table at 05:50 we didn’t get waited on until 06:20 and this was after several waiters walked by and the large table behind us sat after us and got waited on before us . We waited over an hour for our food and we had to have someone from our table go to host desk and inquire about order because our waitress disappeared. She then came by table after inquiring about order and told our ticket was up next it was an hour and ten minutes to get four entrees. I understand delays happen but your staff shows no care or concern . We talked to “kitchen manager “ and host at desk and they showed no concern. No manager ever came by table to check in which is so bizarre . After stating how long waited for food the waitress said can offer dessert on the house. After one of us said just take their one entree off before we got food, she had to realize we waited too long. At this point we just wanted to leave it was ridiculous it took that long as other people that sat after us and only had 2-5 people in party and had over 5 tables  around us that got food before us. This establishment is severely lacking in customer service, hospitality and atmosphere. Stay away unless you want to have bad dining experience and poor customer service. Lastly, tried to contact restaurant thru their  email listed on website and email does not even work! It got returned as undeliverable email address  . It was a shame no one in management came by table to check in or apologize , even after several staff members were aware what happened with our service.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREa2RyRTVnRRAB,New Orleans,en,5994

"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to grab some breakfast and this place was highly recommended and had great reviews. We arrived and were seated immediately which was great as there were only 3 other tables with customers at them but it took over 15 minutes before we were attended to. The hostess came by about half way through and said “she comin ya’ll”. The waiter came over apologized and took our food and drink orders and then disappeared in the back again for more than 20minutes. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit and my boyfriend got a brunch burger. Someone else brought out our food and they had my breakfast sandwich on toast instead of a biscuit as I ordered and when I told her it was supposed to be on a biscuit she then asked me “well do you want me to take it back?” My boyfriend’s brunch burger was supposed to have cheese, bacon, egg and a patty on it and it came out with no bacon or cheese. We had to send that back as well. By the time they brought both of our plates back out our food wasn’t even hot. Our waiter came out and apologized for the mix up then went in the back again and we had ask the busser once we were done eating for our check bcs our waitress was still in the back.

Overall, our waiter was not attentive at all and we had to search for her whenever we needed something when there were only 3 other tables with customers in the whole place. when the food finally came out it was wrong and then by the time it was remade and brought out it was cold.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEeHFUNEx3EAE,New Orleans,en,5908

The only bad review I can give this place is the food was not seasoned at all the lemon pepper buffalo was a strange combination. . . . .the chicken tenders looked great however the batter on the chicken was nasty. . . .the fires where salty. .. .the salad was was good though but that's it. I wouldn't eat here again spent a lot of money for terrible food. . .color me disappointed.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkeWZHVUZnEAE,Dallas,en,3170
Since the lady doesn’t work there I guess anymore the service had gone down hill. I order a fish sub. Sub came with just diced Pickles. He didn’t get my order right.

Im already familiar with vegan cuisine, which I’ve been eating and preparing since the 1980s.

"I got takeout for my family.  The person over was extremely nice and very helpful with my order.  When I got to the restaurant my food was packed and ready to go and the cashier was happy to add a drink for me.

The atmosphere when I entered was very in line with their sign saying they'd been open since 1933.  The lighting was perfect.  Everything was clean and I'd say half of your meal was the experience of eating there.

We got a burger with onion rings, chicken tenders with fries, and quesadillas with sweet potato fries, and two cheeseburger sliders.  The total was about $70.  So about $15 per meal and $10 for the sliders.  Which is pretty much in line with food from a restaurant these days.

I enjoyed my sweet potato fries.  I did need to add a little salt.  My quesadilla was enjoyable but not great.   I would ask for the salsa and sour cream to be separate because they were together. It also could have been crispier and had more than just cheese and chicken.  I did ask for chicken and steak but it was just chicken.

My mother-in-law enjoyed her cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, Swiss cheese and mushrooms.  She enjoyed her meal and ate her leftovers.

My husband got chicken tenders with fries.  The fries he called ok.  He didn't eat them all and didn't finish them later.  We did hear them up and they would have been better fresh I think.  There were a lot of tenders about six.  They were thin for restaurant tenders and my husband said they were over cooked.  He called them passable but did eat the rest later so they were edible.

We got onions that nobody ate.  They looked a little burnt.  The sliders were your common sliders they weren't anything special but they were cooked well.

I would recommend eating in because the food would have been better fresh and I think the restaurant's atmosphere would have made up for the ok food.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURONHIzZ2J3EAE,Charlotte,en,2717

We waited a long time to order, our appetizer never came, the pho came out with no limes and the jalapenos were cut huge. Like one jalapeno cut into 4 large peices. Then we asked for fish sauce because the pho needed it. The staff didn't know what fish sauce is. What kind of vietnamese restaurant doesn't know what fish sauce is? Finally got some limes and fish sauce after explaining to the all non vietnamese staff what it is. Once the Pho was flavored with fish sauce and lime it was acceptable.

They will talk smack about you once you walk away whether they helped you or ignored you and just stood there aimlessly when you’re trying to talk to them.

Turns out they’re accurate.

Service was sub-par. None of the staff looked like they even wanted to be there. Our server for some reason seemed irritated at what all of us ordered…why? Lol
The meatballs looked and tasted like they were frozen from a bag. The sauce was alright though.
Bread and “great olive oil” was far from great.
The Caesar was dry, and had 1 little anchovy on it. Pizza was ok.
The cacio e Pepe was wayyyyy undercooked and the cheese clumped (cheap ingredients)
And all of it was definitely overpriced for the quality.
However, the octopus was probably some of the best I’ve had in awhile.

I sat down and was ignored for at least 5 min, the bar was not busy at all there were maybe 6 people total including myself! FInally a woman came up to me said hi and I asked if I could see a menu, she gave me one and proceeded to clean up around me, helped several other patrons at the bar, I sat there another 5-7min with NOTHING in front of me, not even offered a water! I finally just left after I saw 4 men being attended to, they already had drinks and water! Then I saw another man being offered a refill on his wine to seats awsy from me, I was thinking this cannot be real, do they not see me? There was three people behind the bar. This was offensive and will spread the word not to bother going if your a woman eating alone, plain and simple rude and uncalled for. I was there early in the evening the dinning room wasn't even a little busy. In total I waited almost 15 min to see if anyone would come and apologize and take my order.

Jalapeño poppers were good but there were too few for the price. Definitely will come back, an overall positive experience!

We did come back and I tried the country fried chicken salad. The chicken was a little over-fried (extra crispy), and the salad itself was good. Pretty hearty mix of veggies.

"Henry's Majestic: A Disaster From Start to Finish

Starving after Church, Service Left Us Praying for Salvation

We arrived at Henry's Majestic with high hopes after hearing good things, only to be met with a nightmare of a dining experience. Let's just say our Easter celebration went from holy to ""holy moly, this place is bad!""

Reservations Don't Mean Reservations

Despite having a reservation, our party of ten (including restless kids) waited a soul-crushing **hour and a half** for our food. By the time it arrived, we were famished and past the point of polite conversation.

A Sticky Situation (Literally)

A quick trip to the men's room did little to improve our mood. The floor was a disgusting tribute to those who came before us, leaving a lingering question about the overall cleanliness of the establishment.

Food? More Like a Food Quest

The agonizing wait for our entrees wasn't the end of the saga. After finally getting our food, it took another **45 minutes** just to receive a measly dessert.  Apparently, patience is a key ingredient at Henry's Majestic, because you'll need it in biblical proportions.

The Kitchen Gods Said ""No"" to My Friend's Meal

One member of our party never even received their dinner! Two whole hours vanished, and poof, no food appeared. The waiter's excuse of a ""busy Easter rush"" was laughable considering we had reservations. Shouldn't they have been prepared for a holiday crowd?

The Service? Non-Existent

Our waiter, Sam, tried his best, but  it wasn't enough to salvage this disaster.  There were no apologies, no attempt to fix the situation, just an acceptance of defeat.

The Last Supper (We Wish!)

This experience left a worse taste in our mouths than last year's fruitcake. Henry's Majestic is a place we'll be avoiding like the plague.  Save yourself the frustration and your hard-earned cash – take your Easter celebration elsewhere.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcV82Sjd3RRAB,Dallas,en,3252

The shrimp was hard to peel, the veggies seemed from a bag, grits were not good, and the cold bar was very limited. The omelets were very tasty as well as the eggs Benedict and turtle soup. However, for $50 pp for a buffet and coffee was not worth it for us. We would rather have brunch at any of the many other restaurants in the area for the same price. Saint John is a little cheaper with a much better caliber of food and experience.

It was also played at a nice, audible-but-not-intrusive level. My partner and I could easily hear each other talk. The service was great, and our server was very patient and knowledgeable about the whole menu. He also gave good recommendations.
The food was amazing. Best tofu I've had in years. The duck was great, and the corn fritters were good. All the fried foods were light, not greasy and heavy, and tasted like they used clean oil.

It was late and I was hungry and waited too late to cook after work but this is a no for me. I think this place is more for vegans or something I’m not sure bc they have gsv patty’s and vegan pizza.

"Atmosphere: 5
Food: 4
Service: 2.5

I was looking for a place to take my boyfriend for a celebration dinner, and this place had such a cool vibe on the pictures online and we love Asian food. The location is at a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking, and I promise the inside looks nicer than the outside. The inside is cool and modern, and the pictures of the lady on the wall look like my mom when she younger lol.

We came on a Wednesday evening and there was plenty of seating indoor, and at the bar, but we opted for outdoor seating since it was so nice out. I also saw a sign for a great happy hour deal, so I'll have to come back one day.

Let's start with the food. We ordered the Golden roll, and the pork belly buns, and both were delicious! For my entree, I had a Thai noodle dish that was extremely flavorful, while my boyfriend got the Korean rice bowl, which was not bad but not quite to the standard of the other dishes in our opinion.

Our service was not fantastic and was the only downside of our meal. Although our server was ok, she was a little crass and borderline curt, something that I would expect from a local dive bar, but not a nicer place like this. At first I chalked it up to her being young and similar in age to us so she might have been more informal to be relatable, but at the end when we asked for the check, I wasn't sure if I had finished my meal enough to need a box. She said that she was either bring a box now or not coming back, which I thought was a little rude and out of nowhere. Of course she never came back to check on us after that either even though we were still dining for another 20 minutes. It was just a sour way to end an otherwise nice dinner for a special occasion.

I was also shocked and a little offended to see a 30% tip option. Tipping has gone out of control and the guilt of selecting a more reasonable tip amount puts customers in an uncomfortable place, especially when the service was not great.

I'd love to come back to try more of the menu because we had a nice experience in terms of the food and atmosphere, but I would hope to have a different server if I were to come back.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENzRuTkFREAE,Charlotte,en,2367
"Mama's Cocina Latina food prices have increased significantly! The cashier mentioned the increase occurred within the past week. And while i greatly understand inflation has hits many levels, please don't skimp on the food quality!

"We have eaten here many times since it opened. We had guests in from out of town and it was a perfect place to meet. Mason our server was the only good thing about the night. Our Caesar salad had absolutely no taste at all. Followed by a chicken parm that was pounded so thin and fried we had to ask for a steak knife to cut it. At $26for chicken parm I do not think it was even an entire chicken breast. There was nothing moist or juicy in this entree at all. Also ordered was a maybe 2 inch by 3 inch piece of eggplant parm for $24. The veggies it came with were good. Clearly the portions have gone down and the prices have gone up. Our guests did not finish their food and I believe were just being polite in not saying it was not good. To top it off on the bill they added a non cash adjustment for using a credit card!!

Just ate there Friday. Was excited to try the turtle soup. Tasted like canned chili. The Sazerac I ordered tasted like NyQuil. The oysters Rockefeller looked like they’d been under the food warmer for a while. Couldn’t taste the oysters.  The blackened pompano was 1/2 of a barely legal pompano. So little meat.

Parsley is only green and is in the container. MOLD is on the fork…. 2. The salad smelled spoiled. The replacement smelled proper which means they brought out new salad, not the previous batch.

We ordered a custard filled French toast as an appetizer but instead of vanilla, it had a lemon custard that was delicious! It came with caramel walnut that were delicious: they even had a little salt on them.
I had the breakfast nachos that featured home made chips, two eggs, pico, guac, black beans, etc. I asked that they add bacon to the mix because bacon makes the world go round!

"The vegan beignets are amazing! SOOO GOOD! I loved the power breakfast shake as well. The grits were classic. I personally found the layout of the vegan menu confusing. It wasn't until I looked again a second day that I found beignets under dessert way down at the bottom of the page (okay--I can see that, I guess) and (really confusing) pancakes mixed in with the breakfast sandwiches. The sausage patty was the worst! a blackened orange-ish mush. I went back for beignets, and I'm so glad I did! I am sure they are also probably amazing for lunch.

"Great food. Good service. However, we had to wait for a long time for the food to arrive after we ordered. The atmosphere was nice. The place was overcrowded, probably because of the convention that took place near that area. The only thing that I didn’t like is the overprice of the food.

"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would! The guy at the counter doesn't speak clearly. The selection of food was down to nothing and did not look fresh (honestly you couldn't even tell what anything was). I ordered a tray of sweet plantains to be filled up ($10's worth) and the tray was only a quarter of the way filled. I asked of they could fill up some more because I know the cost of plantains and that was unreasonable. It was as if they had charged me a whole dollar per slice! They guy went to the cook who told him to tell me that of I want more I could pay for more. I was live it and told them to keep their plantains and walked away. They didn't care one bit to have a dissatisfied customer. Mind you, I am caribbean and I can tell they only cater to you if you are Haitian and can speak their language. My husband has also been here multiple times and it has been a negative experience every time.

The cheese fries were a joke a not even a sprinkle  of  bacon for $7!  The burgers had no type of seasoning at all! The one start is for the patient overworked cashier that took my order!

They brought the starters and the entrees at the same time. When I pointed this out, the server asked what I wanted. I told her that was up to her. So she did nothing. Then, when we were finished,  she asked if we wanted desert. I told her we'd like coffee after I finished my beer. I still had 1/2 a beer left when she brought the coffee.

The cashier was very kind and polite. She took the time to answer questions for all the customers ordering and offered recommendations when inquired. We had a fairly big order, so the wait was approximately 25-30 minutes.

"I’m not even a picky eater (and I was very hungry) so I’d have eaten even a mediocre meal and enjoyed it at that point - but I still had to send back a few items.

The calamari tasted like soggy batter, probably the worst calamari I’ve had.

My steak had far too much butter. It was drowning in it to where the steak tasted awful.

When I mentioned to the manger they just argued with me and then picked it up and walked off.

I didn’t know if they were making a new one, or refunding me and not bringing a new one, or what - until server explained what the plan was.

I don’t want to only point out negatives always try to be balanced - our server was nice and honest, the wine was quite good, and so was the desert.

That said, for what it costs they really do need to work on how they prepare some dishes to be more consistent- and they need a manager who can communicate effectively or arms who actually cares about having standards.

As many have noted in the last 9-12 months of reviews the place has gone downhill.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkN3B6LUd3EAE,Cary,en,1937

"My recent experience at Lemonade Restaurant left much to be desired, and various factors contributed to an overall lackluster visit. The food, including the chicken breast and salmon dishes, fell short of expectations, with a notable lack of flavor and a disappointingly dry texture. It was evident that the kitchen may have overlooked crucial elements that elevate a dining experience.

Adding to the disappointment was the sparse crowd; we were the only patrons at 7 pm on a Saturday night. This near-empty atmosphere was further highlighted by the visible departure of several potential diners who seemed unimpressed with the offerings. The lack of a bustling ambiance raised concerns about the restaurant's appeal and left us questioning our choice for the evening.

Unfortunately, the service didn't manage to salvage the experience. The servers appeared disinterested and failed to provide the helpful and attentive service one expects in a dining setting.

On a slightly positive note, the lemonade drinks offered a modest reprieve, providing a decent refreshment. However, they were not enough to counterbalance the subpar food and lackluster service.

In conclusion, Lemonade Restaurant's underwhelming food, poor service, and a conspicuously empty dining area on a Saturday night collectively painted a picture of an establishment struggling to meet expectations.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTdicHBnRRAB,San Francisco,en,4553

"The place isn't the most appealing, but their food is great! I have lived in the immediate neighborhood (DC native born and raised otherwise) for about 2.5 years and only started going here last year off of a bartender's recommendation as what he called ""the best fried chicken"" when it came to ordering out. I doubted him, I did.

Now, I won't say it was the BEST, but it certainly was some real good fried chicken. And the pieces were great sizes. I always get dark meat, if that matters. Burgers, onion rings, and their biscuits are fantastic as well. When I did order burgers, always the Mushroom Swiss. But I haven't gotten anything but fried chicken there since last summer, so I can't say much about it today?

I must note, within the past few months, I've noticed their fried chicken is consistently smaller than they used to be. They taste fine still, but due to being significantly smaller, they're not as juicy. I unfortunately don't find it to be as worthwhile for that anymore. Maybe I'll try their burgers again and see if that changed at all.",ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5d1AwRBAB,Washington,en,4919

"We went to dinner at the Grill and Vine restaurant as a party of seven on April 8th. Five of the people were satisfied with their meal, but my daughter and I ordered the kale and quinoa salad, which was extremely sparse. It had virtually no quinoa, possibly one cut up apricot and one cut up cucumber and dressing that was advertised as curry, but tasted like pure oil. The kale was very hard and inedible. Each of us was charged $16 for our salads which amounted to $32. We were both extremely disappointed and upset but were hosting guests from out of town and did not want to complain or have to wait 20 minutes for new dinners if we ordered them. It was already a long wait to get our food originally. I am extremely upset and no one is getting back to me from management. My voicemail is sitting ignored. I offered to scan and send a copy of our receipt so they could give me a refund which be would be a small portion of what we spent  I am looking for a refund for those two salads .Wish me luck.

Ok so I just came here for the first time yesterday (Sunday). The actual dining area is fairly small but clean. We found a table pretty easy. Atmosphere was very Mexican and interesting. The waitress(/busboy/dishwasher) came to us promptly and gave us the paper menu. The writing on it was so small and the place so dimly lit that I had to pull out my flashlight to read it (no big deal). We asked for 4 different juices and every time she came back to tell us they didn't have that. We finally settled for mango smoothies and our food order. Food came out and we didn't see the waitress for the remainder of our meal. I had to ask three times for water before she came with the carafe and two glasses. Her demeanor was dry and not friendly but she was all smiles for the regulars at the bar. In a nutshell the food was really good but the service was not.

Incredible, especially for the area, like the prices don’t need to be that reasonable but they are, and I love that for their customers.

"I googled Haitian restaurants nearby and spotted this one. I parked my car and said hmmmm this is a tiny place…hey let me try it anyways. I went in and the gentlemen behind the counter was so professional and kind. I’ve complimented him because in my opinion it is very hard to find an all around great Haitian restaurant or Haitian food business. I came in and didn’t know what I wanted. He walked me through making up my mind. He had patience, a great tone of voice, honesty, great listening skills and such a positive energy. This is exactly what ANY restaurant should be like.

The food was amazing - GREAT PORTION  I ordered du ri jon jon ( black rice - most people call it but the correct name is dried mushroom rice ) with legumes and baked macaroni and Soup Joumou! YUMMY !!!!!! The legumes was amazing because it didn’t have too much acid in it. Some places love to add acid or too much spice to the legumes but this one was perfect! The rice was amazing also because it was fully cooked. I really don’t like ordering this kind of dish or ANY and Haitian food that is not fully cooked! I applaud this place!

I rarely write reviews but when I do it’s serious! I would like to also say I applaud the owner for believing in him and hiring him. This man will go far in life. Please continue to support employees like him. I have to also give a round of applause to the people in the back who put their work in making the food as well. I just can’t write this review and forget the employees in the back. They are part of the business as well! It’s not easy waking up everyday cooking and serving people - it can be challenging. I applaud this place. For such a small place to eat-the service and food is amazing! This goes to say never judge a book by its cover. You never know the greatness it has.

Please continue to do well in the community. I appreciate your business!

Sincerely,

A loyal customer",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaNU1INzFnRRAB,Boston,en,1348

UPDATE:
Although still confused and disappointed that I could not get a phone answered before heading to Luna's - once we arrived we were treated very well. Every accommodation was made to service us to our liking. The foods were varied, fresh and delicious!! You could tell the chef and staff take great care and pride. The place is IMMACULATE!! A must for me when dining out. I loved the Latin cuisine infusion to traditional dishes. The servings were ample enough by my measure [I'm not a glutton and understand portion control] and aside from being delicious everything was fresh and prepared to order. Unlike many who commented here, we did not find rude, neglectful staff on hand; nor did we find the prices outrageous for these ""Biden's - Build Back Better"" out of control inflationary times. If they put on a general recording on the phone to answer FAQ, this would be a huge help. But answering the phone is even better!! We merely needed to know if they in fact were OPEN and hadn't succumbed to a Biden Administration induced demise. We were happy to learn they hadn't!!

So when you order they'll bring it outside to be cooked. It appears to be a family owned restaurant and the staff is really nice. I don't know any Chinese (I should), but I usually just point to the item I want and say how many. I've returned 3 times in less than a week since it's so easy and yummy.

"Amazing spicy fried chicken (I know it’s bad for me, but I always need to get 2 and eat them right away), oxtail, curry goat and stewed chicken. Get the peas and rice and cabbage and ask for extra gravy. Best Jamaican food! We could walk to Flames from our house and STILL go Only One! A medium can feed two people, easy.

"Picked up a take-out order and got home to realize it was missing salsa as well as the salad dressings with the salads I ordered, which is the best part of the salad. Drove all the way back to pick up the missing items and the worker was rude and not apologetic at all. Very disappointed in this customer service.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbnJqSTBRRRAB,Charlotte,en,2427
Great homemade Mexican food,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROd3NtVktBEAE,Dallas,en,3195
This modest storefront is home to outstanding flavors and service. We stopped for dinner while visit f from out of town based on other recommendations. It  exceeded our expectations! Can’t say enough about the pasta or the service. And it’s walkable from many of the hotels in Buckhead; there’s also ample parking. Thanks for a great meal!,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqeFp5djVBRRAB,Atlanta,en,541
It took a minute but the smoothies were awesome. They cut all the fruits and veggies fresh in front of you and you can taste it. Wonderful on a sunny day in Atlanta.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREM0lMSzBBRRAB,Atlanta,en,79

"We weren't even residents at this hotel but we had 2 amazing meals at the Rib Room!

We had lunch sitting at the bar one day, right next to the live jazz band that is fantastic! We had the crawfish Étouffée and the rib debris po boy. Everything was delicious! We also had an amazing bartender named Wil who was very attentive, kind and funny!
We came back the next day for brunch and had the avocado toast, the cheese grits and the debris omelette. Once again, everything was delicious.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEc3Jla0VREAE,New Orleans,en,5543
"No dine in seating.
Order and pick  up. I guess that's why they call it a Wingstop.

I made an app order and I gave myself plenty of time after placing an order (25mins).
Ordered a 10 piece Hawaiian and a 5 piece spicy.
Received 12 and 6 so I appreciate them not undercutting the count.
Drum sticks were a bit dry but that's goes without saying. Wings were great.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkeE5ycHBnRRAB,San Francisco,en,4832

Terrible experience. There’s no structure or organization. We waited over an hour for us to get an actual server. There wasn’t any apology or comp. Our food wasn’t that good either. I’ll definitely won’t be returning.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREdTZHYVJnEAE,Atlanta,en,299

Food was great...service fast and good...servers personality plus...need to know that atmosphere by servers is raunchy and crude..,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMEpQbjJBRRAB,Dallas,en,3458
"Hole in the wall. Drove by twice. Had the boiled shrimp, corn and potatoes and ate them on the tailgate, this place is grab and go. The shrimp were spicy, the potatoes made me cough. Delicious.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkaU9hRldnEAE,New Orleans,en,6416
"Been coming here for 7 years. Never been so abused as I have been on my most recent visit.

Walked in. There was no line. Great. No crowd meant that I knew I’d get my order soon. 30 minutes of waiting, I watched six people that arrived after me get served their food and start to leave. At that time I start complaining to the guy at the window… He’s just telling me you gotta wait up to another hour (because they got busy). I’m openly arguing with him and showing him the time of purchase… It’s only then he realizes that he’s in the wrong. Two minutes later a poke burrito shows up. - the burrito that gives me gastroenteritis six hours later.

I made an effort to drop them a private note on the back of their square receipt  (which asks for feedback), never heard back.

This place is milking all the Goodwill it earned during the pandemic. And I wouldn’t be surprised if it starts to collapse soon.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqaXZUOWZ3EAE,San Francisco,en,4524
"Am I the only one who thinks of Bob’s Burgers when I visit this place?  The husband/wife team always find a way to mention the kids. There’s a tangible passion for the food. And there’s seldom a wait even though “Pesto’s” next door is cranking out “jalapeño poppers” to the masses.  All they need is an “arepa of the day” board.

Now for the food …. It’s delicious!!! And a little different from what you’ll find anywhere else. My wife has celiac and is also vegan. She LOVES a dedicated gluten free facility with plenty of options.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkOGF1YXZBRRAB,Atlanta,en,94

"Don’t come and eat here, the front person who was charging me was so rude and nasty to his customer. It’s a place where you want to want to enjoy your food. I don’t recommend and eat here!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMEpqc3NnRRAB,New York,en,3919
"Had a $40 takeout and in one of the takeout the fried rice was stale, old and had that getting rot smell.
They must have given me someone else’s return of fried rice and dipped it in one of my orders.
This ruined the whole meal as the rotten odor contaminated with the rest of the meal such as the meats.
Place is shady looking, I guess not enough lights.
FYI there is no walk in, orders are placed via the store front window.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0OU9YZE53EAE,Charlotte,en,2746
Here food was good also delicious. Employees and management were friendly and their response was quick.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREcXYtUnFRRRAB,Charlotte,en,2528
"It's not about the ambiance.  It's about chicken fried rice with salted fish,   snow pea leaves in garlic sauce as well as bitter melon with beef in garlic and black bean sauce.  Shrimp and vegetables with stir fried noodles is also very good.  In five months of eating here I never had anything I didn't like.  I think the same couple  have been running it for 35+ years.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4OU0zSzlnRRAB,San Francisco,en,4755

"Beware! This is not a Cuban owned nor operated restaurant although its said to be Cuban. I just recently visited this place hoping to eat some Cuban food since I'm not home and what a SAD surprise it was. To start, the staff is super rude. When I asked for a Cafe con Leche, they dont know how to make it. The dont know what a Cuban Toast and a Cortadito, yet they claim this is a Cuban restaurant.  When I asked if they were Cuban, they said very rudely ""NO ARGENTINIANS"" and in a very rude manner. And surely the food they cook isn't Cuban at all.

Best of luck if you decide to waste your money in this fraud of a restaurant.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpbXR2NFlnEAE,Seattle,en,4876

"I ordered through Doordash, had to call to make a request and the young lady who answered the phone was so kind and respectful. My food came quickly and was still a good temperature. The wings were fried perfectly and were good. I wasn’t too excited about the fries, but that’s because I don’t care for those type of fries in general; there wasn’t an actual issue with them. Will def be ordering from here again and trying some of their other menu items.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkd2FUbFdREAE,Atlanta,en,977

The food is overpriced for what you get. Yesterday was my 3rd time and once again one of my hot dogs was cold… like it was in a refrigerator. The polish is not jumbo and the side portions are all for the amount they charge. The food is def good but 24.00 for a regular size hotdog and polish is a lot.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5MnJTUWZBEAE,Atlanta,en,755

Probably some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. The creamiest hummus with loads of flavor. Really good baklava. Don't be put off by the fact this is inside an unassuming bodega - wfich ny the way has literally every kind of single serve beverage you can imagine as well as a huge vairiety of snack foods I've never seen. This is not an eat-in establishment. Take your food to go.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqeXBMbkZ3EAE,New Orleans,en,5952
