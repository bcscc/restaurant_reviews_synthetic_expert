"I am saddened that I have to give this restaurant a poor rating because the customer service was excellent. The young lady at the counter was very polite and professional. However, the rib sandwich that I ordered was absolutely terrible. The ribs were small they were dry and hard for the price that I paid $10.89. I got three very small bones. So the rating that I’m given is not for the customer service it is most definitely a rating of a 2 rating of 1 to 10 on the item and a 10 on the Customer service. This was my first time so I do plan to revisit to try one of the other items to give it a second chance. However, after this time if the item isn’t good I will not go back.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURsaTdYY3dBRRAB,Atlanta,en,0

"I live on this side of town and have never tried Stems so I decided to try it out while supporting a black owned business. I ordered the 3 wing breakfast ($11.50 + tax) and a side salmon patty ($5 + tax).

3 wing breakfast: OK - comes with grits and eggs (scrambled), with choice of toast or biscuit. Eggs were light and fluffy but, grits were undercooked and very ""gritty"" along with 3 very small lightly seasoned wings.

Salmon: Horrible - appears to be a precooked frozen patty which was spicy and dry. Definitely not like any fried Salmon patty I've ever had.

All in all, the staff was friendly but I didn't care for the food bought today. I may try other dishes in the future.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMElEaHdBRRAB,Atlanta,en,18
"A beautiful restaurant with absolutely wonderful food and attentive service. We have been going to WIN for a number of years and have always enjoyed our experience and meals. Over the years the menu has changed but the quality of the food has remained consistently high, delicious, and interesting. They offer wonderful coffees and delicious drinks, the Kuno Fashioned being a must try!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcXJTVF93RRAB,Atlanta,en,55

"Had a wonderful experience here. We had 16 course omakase tasting, and added few additional pieces right before desserts. Every single course was beautiful and delicious. Especially the design of plates/objets went perfect with each piece. For some of them, I felt like I was looking an contemporary art! Chef was super professional(Sorry I forgot to ask your name, you were the best) and provided enough(but not too complicated) explanations for us.

For drinks, welcome drink was amazing lovely. Crafted cocktail was bit strong and too flavourful to me. Not balanced. I also ordered sake flights, which was the best choice. Portion of sake was not much, nor
little. Server explained/recommended each sake and told us which sake would go well for each dish. We told them we're celebrating PHD defense, and they put small congrats graduate decor for our dessert. Gift after the course was also quite impressive - a sweet treat and teabag. We had to wait about 20 minutes because other people came late, but I was not angry as the chef/server explained and apologized enough.

Overall satisfied. Definitely will come again to try 25 course.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEc28zUFR3EAE,Atlanta,en,69
"The atmosphere was really nice and laid back.  Their service was amazing and very professional.  We ordered the “Purple Moon” Açaí Bowl Smoothie.  Sorry, after I realized I should’ve taken a picture, it was all gone.  YUMMY

"Update: Dec 2023- awesome Mike at bar. I went alone, so sat on a high chair at the bar. Mike made me feel like I have company. Next time I am coming for him.

Went for an office dinner with colleagues. Interesting and tasty menu items. Good choices on alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages.

Ambience and atmosphere is simple. Spacious. When we went it was less crowded. Service speed is ok. Update: when crowded, it becomes very noisy- difficult to have decent business conversations due to close proximity of seats.

I gave one less star - we ordered whole wheat paratha - which was bit flaky than soft. Rest of dishes were good in taste and quantities.

They give a parking coupon when you check out. It's valid for 2 hours.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN3JyM0dREAE,Atlanta,en,169
One of my favorite breakfast spots . They never disappoint. The food is always consistent in flavor and the the customer service is always top tier . Most times I go alone and have great conversations with the bartender .,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeWFyUUVBEAE,Atlanta,en,173
Both mine and wife's Benedicts were more than just a little over cooked.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREbXNpR0hREAE,Atlanta,en,175
"Great location and parking option. Greet staff was great. Once seated, the time for beverages and placing our order was acceptable, but it plummeted downhill from there. The waitress is the reason for the negativity of this experience. She was very inattentive.  Everything we received was only after continually flagging her down and asking for it. The wait time for the food was unacceptable, but then there was an additional four minutes of waiting for silverware in order to partake in the food that took forever to get there. The young man who busted the tables was extremely pleasant, personable & commendable. I actually tried to give him the tip, but he stated he was not allowed to accept it.  He definitely was deserving of it. There were four of us in the party, and everyone enjoyed their food except for The Floridian omelette, either the crab meat or the sauce was spoiled and it ruined the entire dish.  Probably unlikely to return to this establishment.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREM0tpazlnRRAB,Atlanta,en,177
"Wow - this place did not disappoint! My wife and I came here with our newborn for our two year anniversary because we love Ford Frey and hadn't tried this place. We had a semi – hard time determining what to get because it all sounded so good. We landed on getting two pastas and an entrée to share. the pork chop was one of the best we have ever had and the mushroom topping and cheesy polenta were out of this world! The pastas were also extremely good. Our waiter, Danny, was very kind and helpful and took good care of us on our anniversary. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back. oh, and we went on a Tuesday and it was not very crowded.",ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdjVsVhAB,Atlanta,en,188

"Update- Went to Pricci’s tonight for dinner for a return visit.

FABULOUS.

Had a calf liver starter with grits that was outstanding. The Fritto Misto was delicious- just the right amount of breading and lightly fried.  The veal chop was remarkable. It was perfect. My dinner guest had the pasta with shrimp, which was delicious, and the other guest had the cippino. The service was 5 star. Kudos to the
chef and the restaurant. I will definitely return.

Went to the restaurant tonight because I had a gift certificate. Five of us dined. I ordered the Veal Milanese, which left a lot to be desired.
My broccolini could have been better. Two others at the table ordered the Bronzino, and split it.  After telling the server, a manager came over,  the Chef came out to apologize for us not liking some of our entrees and allowed us to choose other entrees.  The lamb chops, which were a replacement,  were fabulous as were the truffle fries. The other dining companion had the pork chop which she said was delicious and another had the Chilean sea bass which was fully devoured.

Suffice to say, , but KUDOS to the restaurant for doing everything right to
take care of the issue.

The Chef was a joy and  the manager was very nice,

If you go, get the lamb, Chilean Sea Bass and pork chop.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0c0kzakVBEAE,Atlanta,en,209

"Not that great of an experience. How is it fair that  the menu has a “truffle” udon pasta when  you know how truffle is expensive… They ran out of truffle but still want to sell the udon pasta. Thats fine too… but why are you going to refuse to accommodate us with a price adjustment when your restaurant ran out of truffle??? I think that was inconsiderate knowing that the topping is probably why the pasta is so expensive. I did not appreciate that and this ruined my experience with them. I will not go back to this location.
The manager did not even bother to speak to us. She sent the waitress to tell us “no” when we kindly asked for a price adjustment… like ok! I hope you get richer then.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqb1pycjJBRRAB,Atlanta,en,315

Just horrible!  Ordered honey bar-b-q wings with fries (approx $14 per plate x 2).  It was the worst wings we ever had.  We ended up throwing out the food. The chicken tasted stale like it was left over from yesterday so it was reheated in old cooking oil and then it was buried in the sauce.  It was so tough…get ready to chip your temporary crown and throw up for days.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkbmRXVVVBEAE,Atlanta,en,327

"Waitress was attentive, helpful,  and friendly.
Atmosphere was cool,  music was cool, they couldn't change the TV channel for some reason.
Food was ok, not bad at all,  but not amazing. Drinks were weak (if you're a drinker), really sweet. Taste good,  but kool-aid, in my opinion. Probably drink 5 and just have a buzz.

I gave it a 4 because I didn't like billing.
If you have 5 or more guests, they only give 1 bill. They will only allow up to 3 cards to be charged, you would have to tell the waitress how much on each card.  We ended up just calculating our own meals and drinks, then divided the $99 gratuity equally and sent the money to 1 person to pay. I didn't like that part. I guess it makes since on busy nights,  less confusing for staff and they make sure they get a bigger tip.

Parking lot is small,  we parked in the parking deck across the street and walked over.  People that parked next door at the Auto Zone were getting booted.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbHRyaFNnEAE,Atlanta,en,398

"I'm not sure how anyone is eating here. Coming from the Midwest we had White Castle that had real beef on their burgers, I ordered the three bacon cheeseburger meal. The meat patties damn near disintegrated as I was attempting to eat them which let me know it wasn't real meat. Bacon was decent. They glob mustard on the sandwiches which I don't understand? The fries were the most decent as they're a somewhat comparable to Wendy's fries. In no way shape or form would I ever return to this restaurant.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5aGJ2cHFBRRAB,Atlanta,en,424

"The restaurant was very clean.  I didn't smell any food being prepared when I walked in. (They may have just opened) The pizza on display looked very appetizing. I ordered the Philly and fries. The sandwich consisted of  meat and cheese(not sure what kind of cheese. It looked like it came from a can and was splatted on the sandwich: not melted). There were a few slivers of onions mixed in with the Steak-um meat. The fries were fresh and hot but they covered in black pepper (no salt).
I cannot speak on the pizza. But the Philly was not what I expected based on the advertisement.(Silly me) The portion was pretty small for the price $15.24.
I might go back to try the pizza but the Philly is out of the question.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcF9hTGdRRRAB,Atlanta,en,463

It’s in a random location but this may be the best tapas place I’ve been to in Atlanta. We thoroughly enjoyed the tapas and also the paella. To the extent that we’ll even consider catering from them in the future. The service was great and the space and live music was great on a random Wednesday for us. We’ll for sure be back!,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeDZTbXBnRRAB,Atlanta,en,538

"We had a wonderful dinner here. It’s on the expensive side but the dishes are high quality and full of flavor.

To start we had the crab avocado salad, lentil salad with peaches egg and burrata. All three were excellent, but I think the crab was the star.

To dinner we had the steak frites and the duck confit. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly and the duck was super crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth on the inside.

We finished with the creme brûlée and lemon tart. The lemon tart was especially fantastic.

Our waitress was very friendly and helped us pick the perfect cocktails to match our preferences.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREelllQ1NBEAE,Atlanta,en,562

Oh, WOW: absolutely floored by everything. Phenomenal food, superb service, and romantic atmosphere.

Escargot was to die for, literally. Frites were delicious and the steak, you ask? Oh my God... it left me rethinking our frequency of visits to Fogo de Chão, I kid you not.

Cocktails at the bar are a must, so arrive much earlier than your reservation (don't come without one!).

Ridiculous.to high in this black neighborhood the have a sign on the front door stating a special for $6.99 to draw you in but what people don’t know it’s one piece of fish  with fries  so just ordered the SURPREME fish sandwich the fish tasted as if it been frozen for quit some time. I come past here every day Now I see why it’s always empty all so at the counter on the glass oysters was $32 for a dinner Omg  and the other prices the kids that was working there said the the prices were incorrect and for meI said Wow  take me to the food  was horrible. My coworker bought horrible. I love salmon.a catfish sandwich two piece but it turned out to be nuggets made into a sandwich I know that their in business but your over priced. I also notice the gallon of tea when I was getting my can soda the tea was priced at $75 cash and $80 credit bee my mind well we all said you got once but never again everyone who came in once they seen the prices the left. You are a big pier I never told them any thing about how your food was it was garbage  for sure I had to edit my review after you came back with the lies you have kids working with no!!!!

It happened twice to me. The restaurant uses a website called Skipli which uses Doordash as third party. If your order is lost or damaged, the restaurant will do never about it and tells you to contact the driver or website. Doordash can't do anything either.  Skipli does not even have a way to contact them since it is a marketing site. The first time the restaurant forgot the added veggies I had paid for. Since it was 5 dollars and I just brushed it off.

"We have been long time customers of this location. We even hold our annual company Christmas parties at Ruth's. However, last night we wanted to have a nice meal, but had a time limitation, due to friend leaving on a flight. We decided to get our meal ""to go"" so that we had some schedule control. We ordered on 4-11-24 at 4:30 pm online with a 6:30 pick up. When we arrived no one new anything about our order. The server at the bar was extremely friendly, apologetic and was helpful, but returned without the order. We showed the receipt and she agreed that all was in order. The server said they would get ""right on it"" and  would have our order soon. At nearly 7, she brought out the order.
On the way out, we asked to speak to the manager. Surprisingly, he was aware of the situation, but did not seek us out. Whether intentional or not, he came across as aloof and unconcerned. He said that there was little he could do since we had paid for the meal online. He said that they didn't know their ""tablet"" wasn't working and they didn't receive the order, so.......

In an upscale dining establishment like Ruth's and particularly since we have been long time customers, we would anticipate a better experience. Frankly, we would have rated the service 0-1 if not for the server that helped us at the bar.

Sadly, based on this experience, we will take our business elsewhere.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMWNUTTRRRRAB,Cary,en,1930

"We had an outside table. I went here yesterday because I wanted to spoil myself for working hard the past week. I certainly went to the wrong place. I ordered bourbon chicken and orange alcohol drink. Also, i ordered crab cakes as an appetizer. They were horrible. It was falling apart, very soggy. But I didn't even complain about that. My husband tried, and copied my drink ordered. When they brought the drinks to the table my husband didn't like the drink it tasted sour and bitter. Mine was nice and sweet. He told the waitress and she asked the manager if they could switch out for something more pleasant. And they denied it and said we would have to pay for both. They are not in the business of giving out free drinks. Which was fine, we don't expect them to accommodate their everyone. Then we ordered dessert. We ordered beignets, and they gave them to us raw. The middle was creamy, I'm kicking myself because I should have taken a picture. The waitress said she was sorry and they just hired a new cook. Poor excuse to a paying customer.

"Same review as Peter L. Normally a good experience and the pizza is tasty. However this time they messed up a pizza and offered zero apology or expressed regret for the error. Owner: if you read these reviews, this response is a great way to lose customers. For the price, I’d expect every order to be accurate. Other customers: be sure to take them up on the offer to inspect the pizza before leaving the store. Just pasted the same review from below because i experienced same thing. Manager(was very rude by the way with no apology) who i talked to on the phone was missing when i went back to the store for a refund/remake of pizzas.

I hope this gets to the local owner so that he/she knows how things are run while not present. This is a good way to lose customers. (When i asked for contact info for the owner, they stated that they did not know which i found it was hard to believe)",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGMGJlUjRnRRAB,Cary,en,1969

"Take some pride. Terrible leadership. $140 order for take out and once I arrive (after the recommended 25min wait time) we got to wait another 40min for our food. That led to a cold pizza that we sent back which then led to cold food. The host group up front was doing their best as they tried to handle a ton of people and demands and had an average age of 14 ha! So I don’t blame them. But the owner standing in the back, on his phone several times, walking around like everything was fine was clearly the issue.
Your people are drowning. Now is not the time to act like everything is okay. Jump in and be a soldier. Rescue the drowning and take some pride in your establishment. Your employees are looking to you for guidance and help… unfortunately you were no where around them.
Been here several times. The food isn’t bad and the vibe is fine. But I can’t watch these poor kids treading water while you think everything is good.
Won’t be back but I doubt that matters. If it did, you would have been at the front with the other 15 or so people who were frustrated at their order, wait time, service, and experience.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENVBYMnlBRRAB,Cary,en,2152

"For the longest time I thought their food was good, but overpriced. I never really went often due to the closest location being about 25 minutes from me. However, with fast food costing what it does today, this is a much better value. It's about $12 for their half pound steak burger combo when you add cheese. That's pretty much what you're going to pay for a similar sized meal at a fast food place. I'd rather come here every time given the choice. Service was excellent the last time I was at this location, with the guy at the register being so friendly and helpful with refills, extra ketchup, and asking how my day was going. Tons of toppings to choose for free, but I wish they'd use whole leaf lettuce instead of chopped pieces. Minor complaint. The fries and simple but fresh, crispy, and well salted.

The locally sourced ricotta from Mooresville is killer!

One thing you gotta try: get their house-made focaccia and a tub of their gorgonzola-artichoke dip.  You can make a meal of that.  Just bread and dip, but wow. I do miss the onion-topped focaccia however (discontinued 10 years ago).",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWOXZUQ2NnEAE,Charlotte,en,2441

"Tried to order here tonight and they only have two meat options: chicken and steak. The steak is an automatic $4 upcharge. Upon trying to order from a very reluctant worker (saw us walk up to the counter, look at us, and then walk away), she informed us that the chicken was gone and that the only protein offered was steak. She said it would be four dollars extra, even though they were out of any other option. Poor service and even poorer options.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdHBEMGhnRRAB,Chicago,en,3065

There were three employees gossiping about something that had happened the night before in their personal lives, and none of them engaged or even looked at me. I said good morning and received no response. I then asked for a large coffee and was told only, ""Next counter.""

"Arrived at Chicago Midway airport at 930 AM local time after flying from the East Coast at such an early flight. They were serving breakfast but hey, they had taco breakfast with pulled pork so I am sold. The taco was okay but the service was awful. The person behind the counter looked like she was already having a bad day and did not even call me to say my food was ready. I was standing across the counter waiting and only after about 10 minutes of waiting did I come over and ask at which point she points at a small paper sitting on the counter in front of her. When I mentioned that she didn't call me for my order, she just looks up and away. Shameful. Too bad that places like this--street food of Chicago--has so much potential but then the service just makes it not worth trying.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxc3Z6NnRRRRAB,Chicago,en,3106

First order was phenomenal. Tried the beef Quesabirria and it was so good I pulled over to eat half of it in the car. 2nd order a couple weeks later was dry and didn't see the guac was missing until I got home. 3rd time not much better. Today was my very last time trying. Again missing part of the order (simply no guacamole included) that I was charged for. The container was sideways in the bag (didn't know) and leaked all over the car. I don't understand the huge difference since I first tried this kitchen....but simply done giving it more tries and wasting money. Sorry...can't recommend any longer.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwa3VTeXJBRRAB,Dallas,en,3303

"Didn't even want to give one star but it wouldn't let me post otherwise. I have never been to any fast food location that is this careless about service and food. 1. I specifically went because I wanted a breakfast burrito. Well I was told we're out of all the breakfast food. Not the first time every time I go for breakfast they don't have any breakfast. Lots of time even in the mornings they are out of most breakfast items. Anyways I went ahead and got the #7 Buttery Jack with curly fries. Get to the window and the young man was not hateful, but not welcoming. There were a few young ladies in there all laughing and talking loud, music being played very loud. The atmosphere was almost like you weren't wanted & were an inconvenience to them. But the food, the meat is hard, cold not warm at all, and the fries are cold and so hard you can hardly chew them. The only thing worth having was the Dr.Pepper I got. I will never go back to this location again. I paid almost $14 just to have to go down the street to Whataburger and pay for something else.

The projectors project onto the walls some sort of images I don’t quite remember. It’s nicely lit inside with colorful blueish lights and other colors. The seating arrangement’s alright. A bit too close to other tables.

The food was alright. I personally enjoyed the garlic that came with the main dish. I think that the main dish tasted very interesting? Like it’s an acquired taste. The dish was also very oily though.. (Highly recommended the pork wrapped enoki mushroom skewers! They were lovely.)

The service was fine. The food took a long time to come out and when we ordered take-out afterwards to bring home and it took around 30 minutes to be done. Considering how it wasn’t very busy,  it took a little too long in my opinion.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROaHBMbFRnEAE,New York,en,3998

"I thought that I would drop by and try their food, so I tried steamed shrimp shumai and fried oysters. If appetizers aren't good, the rest might be the same. But....they where delicious. Perfectly fried oysters and steamed shumai. I told them that I would be back...and I will be. And I'll keep you all updated. Their food is delicious. They have unbelievable sushi. The best place I've been to in the Bronx. The place is just a small hole in the wall with one table, but their sushi is quality sushi.

This is Flushing so there are many options if an establishment does NOT pay attention to the needs of its regular customers.

Service was a bit off as the appetizer skewers arrived 10 minutes after the entree. Staff was polite. No tea is offered here but you can request hot water.

"We came around 7:30pm but everything inside already was already cleaned up, with chairs up and floors wet, and all food trays put away. The closing time is supposed to be 9pm. This looks unprofessional to the customers walking in.

The photos and menu looks amazing but the reality is totally different. The guy who works here for sure he is not happy with his job/boss or he is having a bad day. No smile at all the whole time. He made me feel like me eating here is adding more work to his job, especially when he already cleaned up the whole restaurant 1.5 hour before closing time.
Food is served as cold even for meat like salmon/chicken unless you ASK for warm and the way they put the food together on the plate just like throwing everything inside to fill up the plate. You will be surprised by the server handing you the plate by ONE hand like don’t really care how you feel about their service.
I would give 0 star if I could for the quality of food and 00 for the service.
After the dinner I had to go somewhere to eat again because the portion for the price is not even fair.

"Reasonably priced self-serve food bar and made-to-order menu items.

This restaurant in the Cesar Chavez Student Center at SFSU has a large selection of sandwiches and egg dishes, as well as a self-serve food bar. The made-to-order items usually take five to ten minutes. However, a broccoli and cheese baked potato I ordered took twelve minutes, but it was a big spud. The prices for the self-service food bar are calculated by weight (currently $9.75/lb), so you can have as much or as little of the food you want and pay proportionally. They have shrimp, if you're looking to get more value. In my opinion, most of the food is good. I hear their sandwiches are fantastic, so I'll give them a try next time. Service was good. Utensils and napkins were provided. Seating and restrooms were available nearby. Overall, this is a good place to stop for an inexpensive meal.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlM3N1bHpBRRAB,San Francisco,en,4604

I have never gotten so much meat in ramen, the noodle were perfect, and the flavors were amazing. The tempura was very fresh and delish too.

I went on a weekday night, so only 1 other table was there, so the food came out very quickly. The restaurant itself looks like its a bit older, but it doesn't matter since the food is so good.

Upscale Italian restaurant with very good food. The (non Bolognese) lasagna is particularly good. The Bolognese version might be good too, but folks have been going to Cafe Lago for years for the non Bolognese version.

The cook waved at someone in the kitchen who finally came out and said they would get me situated. I sat down outside and they went back into the restaurant for about 5 minutes. When they finally came back out they then informed me that their kitchen is now closed as it is now past 2:30 and it won't open up again until 3pm and the lunch menu is no longer available. I came here for the Reuben only to have the staff stall till after the kitchen was closed for lunch to then inform me that the Reuben was no longer available and they would not make me one, or any other food till after 3pm, despite showing up at 2:20 before the kitchen closed.

"The decor here is nice and a great atmosphere. However, everything else didn't line up. The service was just lacking. We waited about 15 min for a server just to come over to take the order, and then it was very hard to find her when we needed something.

It was a table of two and the restaurant wasn’t full but it took 30 minutes for the mimosas, another 20 minutes for them to find clean glasses for us to use (the first 4 they were bringing out dirty !!! ). Let’s not even discuss how long it took them to make chicken and waffles and an omelette!

The chicken is cooked is sazon and not hard so the chicken was rubbery and could still taste the flour and would leave yellow stains on your fingertips. This made it inedible. Only positive was the salmon omelette.

Lastly, a 20% service fee is added to the bill (this is your servers tip), this could explain the lack of attentiveness from the waiters or waitresses because the fee is not an option.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNmQyLXp3RRAB,Washington,en,5071

Brought my wife… this woman ruined the experience for her. My wife was sitting right across from me, and couldn’t hear a word I was saying due to the insults pouring out of her, or rather, the fat woman’s mouth. 1 star.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5ZzZ2RXZnRRAB,Washington,en,5141

He yelled at me that I need to pay now while I’m waiting. Throughout the entire dine in experience I never got drink refills, checked on if everything was okay, and the pho was mediocre at best.

"I cannot say enough fabulous things about this beautiful venue and Ms. Linda Novak, its proprietress and event coordinator. I approached Ms. Novak with less than one (1) months’ notice and an unusual request to propose to my girlfriend there after discovering that the Swoop-Duggins House was open for private events – years ago, my girlfriend (now fiancée) and I had our very first date “Cellar Door” (bar operated by previous tenant/owner), but I had been advised that it had been shut down in Hurricane Ida. I was so thrilled to see that Ms. Novak was now hosting events in the space again and invited myself over for a walk-through as soon as I got in contact with her. Despite my paltry budget (much less than she normally agrees to rent the space for); an insanely complicated plan for a proposal (I had to lead my girlfriend in through a side entrance that she’d not recognize, then ask Ms. Novak to herd in in 30 guests to the front room within a 5-minute window before bringing my fiancée out to propose to her on the balcony where Ms. Novak had provided a perfect “hiding spot” under a tablecloth for my friend to photograph the proposal, after which I brought her down the courtyard steps where she coordinated the timing of my friend’s dad’s trumpet-playing); an ever-changing number of guests and menu items (from 12 to 35 and then back down to an eventual 30); and two highly-invested mothers participating in the surprise, Ms. Novak graciously and seamlessly pulled off an engagement event that most people that I was crazy for even attempting.

Ms. Novak spent weeks working with me and my friends and family to ensure that everything went right in this multi-layered plan that likely would take the award for “venue’s worst nightmare event” – from coordinating walk-throughs in the week leading up to the event, to actually playing a part in the surprise herself (she went so far as to make fake signage and decorations for another “event” that was to take place that night; and put her acting skills to work to make my charade more believable), she was beyond incredible. All of my guests asked whether she was a wedding coordinator that we could hire, given her flawless facilitation of the entire evening – if only she were available to handle my wedding! Needless to say, my fiancée was thrilled and said yes. We now hope to plan an engagement party or wedding event at the Swoop-Duggins House next year.

As for the venue itself, Ms. Novak has done an impeccable job of decorating the space down to the very last detail – it is New Orleans through and through, and captures the essence of the Crescent City through its décor and ambiance. Cocktails and appetizers were of course fabulous, as well. No way to go wrong with this venue and Ms. Novak. Thank you.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaEtYWFB3EAE,New Orleans,en,5382

When I called Beaucoup Eats, although they didn't see the missing tray on my order, they immediately told me not to worry, that they would send the food right. The food arrived within 20 minutes. It was incredible. The food Beaucoup Eats creates is unmatched, so delicious, so rich! But what really got me was their customer service, hospitality, and kindness. 5 stars-no questions asked!",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNG9iWnRRRRAB,New Orleans,en,6143
"We had a kick-off Budget Meeting at work.  We ordered about 6 items from Beaucoup Eats. We fed around 15 people and everyone enjoyed every single dish.  We ordered Gumbo, Rotisserie Chicken, Ceasor Salad, crawfish corn bread, Garlic Mash Potatoes and Bread Pudding, and every item was extremely delicious.  We will be definitely ordering again. The order also was delivered on time.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDdHB1YWZREAE,New Orleans,en,6144
Everything we ate here was delicious. Loved that the chips and queso came with both tortilla chips and plantain chips. The shrimp burrito had some of the best shrimp I’ve ever had. My husband enjoyed the bone in Al pastor pork chop and street corn grits. Such a great place to grab lunch with drinks and get away from how crazy busy the French Quarter can be.,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENUlybUdREAE,New Orleans,en,6152

"This is a local sandwich place. It isn't fancy but its consistent and fresh. Lunch time's only. I go regularly to get fried oysters.  Something about the way they fry them are the best.
All of the sandwiches are good just depends on what you prefer.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSLWZ1T1VREAE,New Orleans,en,6173
"Usually, pretty good food. I make it a point to stop here whenever I'm in town. Usually, get it to go because there really isn't a place to sit down. This last trip was very disappointing. The quality has gone down, and the place needs some serious attention. I chose the stuffed pepper. It was good, but had me throwing up a few hours later. Needless to say, time to find another favorite place.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcDlQWWN3EAE,New Orleans,en,6176

"The place is half empty. However, they refused to give me a table so I could have a proper lunch experience.

"Short story: it's a hit, and one of the best, mid-scale seafood and oyster houses in the French Quarter, but with some pitfalls associated with being popular. Mixed up beer taps took 10 minutes to switch. Hectic line formation around the corner from the building. But: big, savory, Southern dishes at a relatively fair price, especially during Happy Hour.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcHNiWUd3EAE,New Orleans,en,6246

"Following some recommendations from the darker corners of the interwebs, we decided to swing by this place for some late-night food and a couple drinks. The bar tender, Tyler (or at least I think that's the name he was going by for the evening) was an absolute delight and took excellent care of us. The pours in our cocktails were generous, as were the portions of the food we ordered. The Redfish Poboy was as delicious as it was spicy, and the subtle geeky decor made me feel right at home. It definitely felt like a dive bar, but in the best way possible.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENW9MSTFBRRAB,New Orleans,en,6256

"Luke is a great little French restaurant situated in the Central Business District just south of French Quarter. My wife and I went for lunch and we decided to go all in and try a couple of traditional French items we had never had.

We ordered three items from the ""To Share"" section of the menu. Here's what we ordered:
1) Patê of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Liver
2) Crispy Brussels Sprouts
3) Escargot & Bone Marrow
4) Saison du Pont (beer from Belgium)

I have to say, neither my wife nor myself enjoyed the patê. To be fair, this stuff looked legit. I'm confident this was excellent quality and it just turns out we aren't patê people. The sprouts were fantastic and I was a huge fan of the accompanying sweet pepper sauce. Bone marrow is always amazing, and this was no exception. We enjoyed the escargot and it paired quite well with the marrow and the grilled bread served with the dish.

Service was excellent, food was great quality, and we were in and out pretty quickly. Definitely recommended if authentic French food is what you're looking for.",ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcnVXc1NBEAE,New Orleans,en,6374

"This is a place where we almost always have a significant wait for a table (30+ minutes) but it might be better off peak - I just haven't figured out when that is.
